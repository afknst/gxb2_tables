In short, Guan Yin didn't show any feelings for Aquaris even when she admired her former savior.

Hence, Sonya asks another frequent diner, KongMing, for help. After begging KongMing several times, KongMing finally gives in. KongMing lures and captures Wildtress in a cage. For 7 days and 7 nights, Wildress was held captive in a cage in Sonya's cafeteria, staring at customers eating food and no way to get near them.

78,Librarian,1st Note,"Librarian here. This note is to remember a very special day: Today. I stumbled upon this notebook by accident. The top cover has a large number of schoolgirl's records and information in it. From the looks of the dust on the cover, I am guessing the one who wrote this may have already graduated. I have no idea why she gave this up, but it took my interest. I want to continue recording this information!"
79,Librarian,2nd Note,"I am now studying at the Yume Academy. Although this counts as studying, I am reading books every day and taking notes while doing it. Sooo Booorringgg. Sometimes, I want to be like Sapphire and ask myself ""When did I come here? Where did I come from? Where am I going?"" Pondering those sorts of question. But I want to to be a writer. This gathering, collecting, and recording ""work"" is also a part of becoming a writer. I will try my best to do this work, despite problems along the way. Maybe someday, this note might be useful. Everything could change. Who knows?"
80,Librarian,Memory,"Actually, I don't remember much from my childhood that left a huge impression. What I remember was a vague memory where there was a huge study room in my house. My mother stored all of her books there. I often got lost in that room. I could burst into the room and can't find where I am. At first, everything was a novelty in that room. I was just curious about everything. But right when I got lost, all I can feel was fear and hopelessness. Three days later, my family found me under a pile of books. My fear and hunger were long swept clean by the world within the books."

82,Giana,Dancer,"Giana is the leader of the dancing club in the Academy. Like her sister, they both are devoted and crazy about dancing. She is still looking for someone who could resonate with her dancing. It seems that she needs to find someone to have her sign a contract, making her become an exclusive dancer. But things aren't like in the movies. It's not easy to find someone to offer her contract to sign. That is the reason why others think she is only ""showing off"" her dancing skills."
83,Giana,Dancing Suit,"Although there are no rules nor regulations regarding what to wear on campus, Giana is always wearing gorgeous outfits that stand out. She deliberately wears outfits that show different parts of her body, making her dance move attract people. Though she is never aware of it. It is said that her outfits were designed this way with a fan year-round to deal with the problems from sweating."
84,Giana,Tails,"Many of the students at Yume Academy are fascinated with Giana's tail. Some want to count how many tails she has. Others want to know what the white fluff on the tail feels like. Nobody has succeeded in answering the question correctly. Every time Giana appeared in people's field of vision, she is dancing. People were simply stunned and fascinated by her dance moves. When Giana first enrolled in the Academy, many students were late for their classes because of her dance moves. Giana's sister made her establish the dance club."

86,Succuba,Rumor,"Once upon a time, many people would not dare to mention the name ""Succuba"".""Stop being naughty! Succuba love eating naughty kids and drinking their blood!"" All the senior students on campus would say this to freshmen. It seems to be a good way to hold those new students in their place. In reality, those who know Succuba from way back, see her as just an extremely stubborn little vampire. But after a short period of time and word of mouth, she is the dark lord to others."
87,Succuba,Succuba Guild,"Succuba never thought she will start a gang or organization. After all, she is a vampire and blood is her most important goal. However, those flatterers with bad intentions didn't think so. They came to Succuba from time to time, flattering her in many different ways and convinced her to be a leader of the group. Succuba, without any social skills nor life experience, couldn't resist and made herself the leader of her group. She was called the leader at least, but she's did not actually take charge of anything. The members in the group were just using her name and infamy to raid for their own benefits."

No one knows if Ennmaya made those dark substance, or these unspeakable sinister things found her body (or even the dark materials were her actual body. The look is only her disguise). Anyhow, she looks like the type who likes eating people alive."
91,Ennmaya,Eating People,"From time to time, some would say that they heard Ennmaya blurt out about how she loves ""eating people"". Some even said they witnessed her ""eating"" someone. Each time the Discipline Committee received such messages, they start an investigation. But time after time it led to a dead end, they never found evidence of a student missing, nor clues or leads at the ""crime scene"". Thus, there is no proof that Ennmaya is guilty of eating people."
92,Ennmaya,Dark Meal,"Whether or not Ennmaya really eats people is unknown. But Ennmaya (or the darkness lurking inside her) is widely known as someone who loves eating! Her favorite food is not the dish with fancy looks or the one that is juicy and filled with flavors. It is the one with horrible smells or terrible in appearance. This could be one of the reasons many students like her--- She can deal with all their ""masterpieces"", no matter how it looks or smells, she will never reject eating such food. PS. Whatever you do, do not use a flashlight to shine any light onto her dishes, her dark magic won't like it."

94,Wu Kong,Peach,"Wu Kong is a girl filled with life and energy who is strong, quick, and agile. She hates people who call her ""Monkey"", though her nickname became this way because she can never be satisfied with the number of fruits she eats daily. She has no principle nor a sense of responsibility. Not even for money. Just only for peaches. According to her, peaches are everything."
95,Wu Kong,Peach Garden,"Wu Kong's favorite place on campus is the peach garden. The peach garden was made by Sonya, Bud Elf, and others to supply fruits to the whole Academy. When constructing the garden, they didn't have enough members to finish such a huge project and almost gave up on it. At that time, Wu Kong volunteered to work and build the garden. She can create countless clones of herself with her hair, and the clones took care of the hard labor and grunt work such as planting and delivery. All she required from them in return are more peaches."
96,Wu Kong,Helpless Monkey,"A lot of uneasy and tense events happened on campus recently. As a result, Wu Kong retreats to the peach garden. She just wants to protect her peach trees from getting destroyed. For now, not a single tree was damaged. But under such tense situation, the peach garden becomes less lively. Besides a few unnamed people, nobody goes to the peach garden. Inevitably, this made Wu Kong a little bored, so she made Sonya stop calling her ""Monkey"" and start calling her ""Monkey King"". However, Wu Kong said something that made Sonya, short-tempered as she always has been, really angry. Looks like Wu Kong will need to apologize to Sonya, or she might eat fewer peaches."

102,Caitlyn,Nerd,"Caitlyn is a typical game nerd who plays countless different games every day. She also imagines herself as a character in a game, and is working on the perfect ""Cosplay"". What she calls perfect ""Cosplay"", is actually simply putting Vr glasses on. Not only did she lost sight of people beside her when she put the glasses on, but also she is a huge threat to her roommates. Being hit by a ""Blind"" person is not fun for anyone."
103,Caitlyn,Cool Summer,"Caitlyn's favorite game is the one she finds on an old shelf in the library. It's called ""Cool Summer"", a game where the leading female character wears swimsuits and fight zombies on the beach. She wants to cosplay the character from this game in the frigid winter, so she has to wear extra socks and stockings, and plenty of warm clothes to cover."

If you asked her about her dress, all you can get from her is ""I love this dress, don't you think it suits me perfectly?"""
107,Blowie,Hair Dryer,"The bathroom is the place where Blowie likes to spend most of her time. In fact, she likes drying her hair using the hair dryer more so than washing it. As for what she said, warm wind will blows away the moisture from the hair, just like how it will also blow her troubles away. Each time when she does this, its a quick relaxing therapy session that takes her mind away from everything."
108,Blowie,Weapon of Choice,"Before the previous accident, Blowie never participated in any wars, conflicts, or battle training. However, when she is in battle, her hair dryer not only blows away dust but also the darkness and evil inside.

111,Javelin,Prince Charming,"One day, Javelin was hired by Joan to take a part-time job at a cafe on campus.

That was the day she was called ""Prince Charming"". Since then, Joan has been inviting Javelin to her cafe once every 2 weeks. This is the reason why the cafe is jam-packed with people."
112,Javelin,Target,"Javelin's main goal is to eliminate the wicked and pursue her own path in life. She has a no-nonsense personality and doesn't have time to play. Even outside of class time, she goes on patrols around the campus borders instead of hanging out.

115,Toyo,Guide,"Toyo met Aquaris when they were both training. However, Aquaris was training using a useless training manual that she found somewhere else. Still, she wasn't very good, despite the fact that she trained hard. She had to stop and rest every few minutes. Toyo never helped Aquaris with her training. She just trained by herself over and over. That affected Aquaris as well, although she never thought of asking Toyo for guidance. Whenever she saw Toyo do something, she would follow and try harder. After a while, they both seem to have made some progress."
116,Toyo,Training,"Days have passed and the more Toyo trains, the more powerful she becomes. Like her powers, her body has grown from a weak little girl to grown-up gorgeous lady.

152,Nia,Gap between Sisters,"Nia enrolled in Yume Academy with her sister, Muppet, who she rarely ever cared about. It wasn't until seeing the devastated Muppet after taking too much torture was when Nia finally felt pain. This painful sensation was like being pricked by a thorn. Either because of the love for her sister, guilt, or redemption, Nia started to try saving her sister while looking for her enemy."

154,Silvia,Like a Robot,"Silvia is a robot who has always been alone. She doesn't possess human emotions such as happiness, anger, sorrow, or love. You can't even find one emotional expression from her. Her expression is always cold and indifferent, like a robot. But other schoolgirls never knew that she has an another identity."
155,Silvia,Killer,"For an emotionless killer, comparing her to ""a robot"" is a compliment to her. Silvia can recall the assassinations that she made. Yet, she doesn't know who she swore her loyalty to nor the person who gave her the missions to assassinate. There is no use pondering over these questions. As days pass, she only needs to follow orders. It brings her the most comfort this way."
156,Silvia,Confusion,"After the crisis triggered by the CHAOS FIGURE outbreak, Silvia finally became confused after noticing the data regarding the emotions and mood of students started to fluctuate unusually up and down. What happened that made them experience such massive waves of emotional pain and suffering...? It was the first time Silvia started to wonder what it is like to possess emotions."

158,Alice,Different Side of Her,"Although Alice carries a praiseworthy body that countless number of people on campus is jealous of, she has a silly and adorable personality. This difference made her popular. Every student wants to become friends with her. But only a few people know about the other side of her."
159,Alice,Bold and Decisive,"Whenever she is in combat, Alice showed calm, decisive, and outstanding fighting abilities. This shocked others. Not only is Alice swift, flexible, and possesses excellent judgment and decision-making, she is also courageous and has a heroic fighting spirit. All these merits lead people to have to admit that Alice is a genius in combat that can be hardly found anywhere else."
160,Alice,With Hexa,"Alice has a lot in common with Hexa. They're both frequently in the research room. But they don't talk to each other much. Alice feels a kind of sympathy for Hexa. But apart from this, she also shows subtle and faint hostility towards her. Alice can't figure out the reason behind this. Perhaps its the hatred or vendetta between the two in their previous life?"

162,Masamune,Tactical Genius,"Masamune likes to read books on military strategies and tactics. She knows by heart books about warfare such as ""The Art of War"", ""Six Tactics"", ""The Book of Five Rings"". She flaunts herself as a tactical genius, and she laments for not being born in an age of conflict or strife."
163,Masamune,Warmonger,"Masamune has serious issues of delusion and paranoia. She always imagines herself as a general of an army who plans strategies and tactics and uses them to defeat her enemies. Yet, every time you see Masamune leave with satisfaction, you can see the mess that happened including the students she captured and the livestock kept on campus."
164,Masamune,Dawn of War,"With the Chaos Figure spreading and the conflict between the Discipline Committee and D. E. F. becoming more and more intense, the fog of war pervades the campus. Masamune is filled with joy, believing that a new era of war is approaching. She starts recruiting troops and raising an army. It seems this is a perfect opportunity for her to conquer the world."

166,Priestess,Taoist Master,"Although Priestess is young, she's already a Taoist master, or someone who is finally ""one with nature."" Because she was born with the ability to communicate with nature, she also has strong magical powers. Many who are interested in Taoist methods worship her and seek her to be their master. But she has rejected all of them."
167,Priestess,Love of Chado,"Besides meditating at the top of a mountain, Priestess's favorite activity, is to brew and drink tea with her friends at the Chado club. Yet, she kindly refused to join the club after several offers by the leader. The reason she gave: a spiritual person should not meddle with the mundane world."
168,Priestess,Defending the Campus,"Priestess's lifestyle is to practice ""Wu Wei"", she always claims that she doesn't want any to meddle with the mundane world (At least that is what she says over and over). But if there was ever a battle between Discipline Committee and D. E. F that gets serious enough and affects the security of Yume Academy, she will still stand out and devote her power to protect the campus. At this moment, the students she has already helped countless students."

170,Chevalir,Early Life,"Chevalir, with the blood of a nomadic group of people, was born and raised in the vast prairies. She is naturally gifted in horseback riding. It was said that she hunted and killed a giant adult wolf by herself when she was 5 years old. Chevalir loss one eye, which cannot be mentioned in front of her. Nobody knows the cause behind it. But the black eye patch gives her a heroic look and unique charm and charisma."
171,Chevalir,Congeniality,"Chevalir loves to make friends with like-minded people. She has an outspoken, frank, and sincere personality, which makes it easy for her to become center of attention. But her character could lead to miscommunication and misunderstandings that cannot be explained, which caused her to run into a lot of trouble. So she usually makes amends with students she accidentally offends by bringing them presents. But the presents she gives are so baffling that people think she might have purposely provoke them."
172,Chevalir,Riding champion,"Chevalir is the leader of the Riding Club in Yume Academy, and she continues to hold the championship of the mounting race in campus for many years. This is an honor that is rarely seen in the history of Yume Academy. It has also led her to receive challenges from many other students, such as Wildtress and Pandaria. But Chevalir, with her strong self-confidence, will continue to defend her title."

262,KongMing,Talented Girl,"As the president of the student union at Yume Academy, KongMing also joined the school band. KongMing's personality is described as unfriendly and cold on the outside, but warm on the inside. When she speaks, she tries to appear as mature and sophisticated as possible. In fact, KongMing is truly afraid of being lonely and needs friends. With a high IQ, KongMing spends most of her time practicing in music classroom and contemplating profound questions and problems quietly."
263,Kong Ming,School President,"After ranking first place in the academic examination 3 times in a row, Kong Ming was invited to student union when she enrolled in Yume Academy. When she became the president of the student union, Kong Ming doesn't show up at any of the meetings. However, girls always find undiscussed content, detailed solutions, and proposed plans in notes she left. Therefore, everyone still admired her meticulous thinking despite being absent in every meeting."
264,KongMing,Companion,"It is said that KongMing joins the Music Club only because she wants to track down a song that she occasionally hears. This song affected her so much that listening to it made her feel vulnerable and want to open up to others. KongMing also becomes friend with a fox-eared girl. During the Chaos Figure outbreak, the girl with fox ears, along with her companions, attempts to rescue and save the infected KongMing and others who suffered from the crisis."

266,Fencer,Swordswoman,"Fencer, powerful and self-confident, is a swordswoman. Previously, she participated in all kinds of competitions and challenges at the league's arena. At her peak, she even challenged Saint in a private duel, where nobody knows the outcome. And suddenly, she left the league and began practicing the art of fencing. Some say she is preparing to fight an opponent more powerful than Saint."
267,Fencer,Lord of Frost,"Fencer usually fights using simple sword techniques, so only a few people know whether or not she has other powerful abilities. She has way more powerful abilities. I was fortunate enough to have carried on a mission with her once. At the time, we were in a cave surrounded by enemies, before I could even think of our way out, she left after a short sword dance, saying ""We won~"". My eyes somehow felt really dry and puffy when the echoes were still heard in a distance. After several blinks, I finally realized what happened. The water in the cave disappeared, and in the spot where the enemies were supposed to be, instead were only some ice scraps... and finally there was a sudden burst of cold air."
268,Fencer,The Strong One,"Fencer always rejected invitations from all kinds of clubs and organizations. She says she doesn't need companions. It was her own theory that the strong ones would only care about victories and the beautiful. That's why she can be found either fighting in the League or talking to Hottie. The two ""Ancient Seniors"" have a pretty good relationship together. Hottie even warned us not to interrupt Fencer's training. A couple of days ago, I asked what she was training for, but she left with Saint before I could even get any response from her. Judging by their secretive nature recently, I don't think I can get any more information."

270,Sakura,Sakura Lover,"Most students' first impression of Sakura is that she is a cherry blossom-lover who has a cold, reserved, aloof, and strict personality. Her clothing attires and accessories have the style and theme of the tiny pink flowers. According to Bud Elf, one of her favorite pastimes is watching cherry blossoms bloom. Another pasttime is eating a dessert called ""Sakura Dango."" But no one in the Academy seems to know the recipe."
271,Sakura,Daily Routines,"After getting to know her better, I learned that Sakura actually has a warm personality. It's just that she may lacked social skills. She only came in touch with ""High-Tech"" gadgets after first enrolling in the Academy, and they made her uncomfortable. Her apprehension to these gadgets made her stood out from others. She practiced swordsmanship alone, and the only chance of interacting with others is taking care of the cherry trees on campus with the Gardening Club."
272,Sakura,Popularity,"I can still remember the day she appeared out of nowhere in the Academy. The cherry blossoms were in full bloom that day, and an unfamiliar silhouette wielding a pink blade appeared among the falling petals. Her dance were in perfect harmony with the nature, and it took our breath away. Rumors has it that she was the Goddess of cherry blossoms, while many said she a newborn Fairy in the Academy. Although the truth stayed hidden, her popularity have been rising since then."

274,Psychic,Animal Welfare Club,"Recently, the Animal Welfare Club was recently found by Psychic, who was newly enrolled. She has a dog that is always by her side called Bruno, but she insists that itâs a Servant. The active members of the club include Pandaria and Chevalir, who already had pets before Psychic arrived. Their activities used to be small-scale. But after Psychic joined them, the club gradually expanded. I'm no Animal Protection Expert, but Psychic's frequent appearance near the labs seems very suspicious... Are they experimenting on those pets? I need to investigate some more..."
275,Psychic,Eavesdropping,"
""Are you sure anyone other than Bruno wants these cookies?"" ""Of course! Even if they\'re not effective enough, they will at least be yummy for the servants on campus. As for your Pandy!""
â¦â¦
""Let\'s feed the small robot we met last time, and maybe it\'ll evolve this time!"" ""Chevalir, even with only one eye you shouldn\'t mistake my gems for cookies...""
â¦â¦
""Psychic, why are the servants so rare and weak right now? According to your research, they are native to this land ..."" ""This might be caused by a leak in spacial energy, but I\'m not 100% sure what happened. The only thing we can do is to nurse them back to health."""
276,Psychic,ServantÂ Expert,"Psychic is definitely an expert on animals. Her research results can be seen along with the animals gradually showing up on campus. She called these animal ""Servants"", because their powers are not befitting of their normal appearance. You just need to look after them with care, and they will become your best helpers in keeping the peace on campus. There are two different types of animal treats, one yellow and the other is blue. These treats depend on the different ingredients added according to the servants' characteristics. Although the cookies are food for servants, the human stomach can digest them. I never tried them myself, but rumors has it that the blue ones tastes better, and that theyâre the ones Psychic uses to feed Bruno. She was even seen eating those cookies herself..."
277,Wraith,Communication Issues,"It has been very difficult to get a chance to communicate with Wraith. She tricked me three times when I explained my intentions to her. When I told her that interviewing her would make fewer people disturb her, she finally agreed to talk to me. She stole my pen and hairpin way before I even noticed..."
278,Wraith,Spectre?,"Wraith is a ghost, or at least that's what she wants others to believe. I think her activity range might be restricted to the abandoned dorm building, as she is never seen anywhere else. She probably dislikes sunshine, otherwise the windows of her room shouldn't be shut all the time. She must hate the living a lot, because there's never a ""welcomed visitor"" to her domain."
279,Wraith,Spectre!,"Wraith is indeed a ghost. A very happy one. She is happy because she is not confined to a body. She has ghost friends playing with name No. 1 and No. 2, and do not have to be looked at differently by others. She had been forbiddened in that room for so long that she didn't even know much about the world outside. She was simply afraid of any social interactions. After setting her a time to meet, I'll get Lucifer to come and talk to her. House Demon will surely welcome such a new student. When she joins the school, she will be protected by the school rules. This will surely put an end to those curious people who disturb her."
280,Phoenix,Poor sense of Direction,"Poor is not enough to describe Phoenix's sense of direction. Wherever she is, she couldn't find a way out. The first time I saw her was in the library. Even after guiding her to the history section three times, she still failed to remember the route and attempted to burn her way through. Think I must always lead her to the history section myself in the future."
281,Phoenix,Lost in Thought,"Not only is she terrible with directions, but Phoenix also has a short attention span. She is often in a dazed and confused. If you communicate with her, you will find that her mind drifts away, and she simply responds to your words mechanically. She seemed preoccupied, and she seemed to be pursuing some secrets. Only when she exchanged topics related to the history of the school, did she gets out of her daze."
282,Phoenix,Rumors,"After the last Chaos Invasion, Rumors about CHAOS FIGURE is widely spread among campus. It's said that a secret elite force actually exists and fights against chaos. And Phoenix, who is known as ""the one who reborn in Flames,"" is one of the leaders of the elite force. The source of these rumors is still unclear and the authenticity of them are not certain because of this. But Phoenix has always been acting suspiciously. I think the investigation about her should continue."

It is said that she wants to tear up everything she sees, and she hates blunt weapons extremely because she considers them to be evil things that ruin the beauty of sharpness."
285,Linky,Master,"Just like Phoenix, Linky was also a member of that legendary elite, but they seem to be in different regiments. She never stops talking about her ""Master"", and it is said that she turned from a destructive maniac to a loyal guard since she met her master. Although she still keeps her sense of killing, she has already turned that down a lot."
286,Linky,Past memories,"Who was Linky's master? What happened to that elite squad in the past? Such intelligence is too difficult to get. The only thing we know for now is that she craves for the resurrection of her master and has returned to Yume Academy. For more detailed information, maybe the answer could only be found inside that secret library."

289,CapsuGirl,Rumors,"""CapsuGirl can be acquired from Capsule Machine!"" ""Who did that?

292,Valeera,Magic Genius,"Valeera is a girl with a small form. According to her ex-teammates, she was loved by all in the team. She did not receive proper training as a Mage, but her mana reserves were immense: if used correctly, she won't need a wand to channel her magic."
293,Valeera,Slow Reflexes,"Valeera has very slow reflexes. Although she is easily scared, she will not lose her calm no matter how intense the battle becomes. However, she will refuse to leave her room several days after the battle due to fear. There have been suspicions that the way she felt things is different from most people. From my observations, I'd say that she feels time differently from others due to the high amount of magic always surrounding her. This affected more than her perception of time: her emotions were also slowed by the magic."
294,Valeera,The Secrets hidden in her Spellbook,"Valeera always have a intricate-looking spellbook on her. In fact, it is just an old storybook. She doesn't like studying Magical Theories, and never learned the complex spells: all she did was pour her mana into the words, granting them power. Through this method, all characters from a book would appear at her side, no matter it is a Mythical creature from the fairytales, an honorable knight, or a powerful sorcerer. If you got on her bad side and found her reading a dark tale, it would be wise to stay away from her."

296,Turin,Amateur Atmosphere Reader,"Turin finds it hard to blend in with the crowd, even with her superb computing abilities and her almost endless reserve of knowledge. She acts bubbly and energetic, trying to brighten up everyone's day, but her efforts are often fruitless: most people whom she talks to are often taken aback by her behavior, and the situation ends up awkward at best. However, this doesn't affect Turin at all. She never stopped talking to those she deems interesting, trying constantly to understand human emotions."
297,Turin,"Long-""Lived"" AI","Turin is an AI created by ""Li"", and acts as Observer before Yume Academy's establishment. If you compare Turin's database to Valeera's Grand Library, the records in the former probably way outnumber the latter. However, she seems reluctant to access that database. Although her smile never falters when anyone mentions it, what she truly feels about it is kept to herself."
298,Turin,Computer or Human?,"In the end, is Turin just an AI? In everyday life, she tries her best to make everyone smile; on the battlefield, she becomes anxious when her friends are hurt. In my eyes, she is a normal girl, just like everyone else: she is considerate of others' feelings and tries her best to be kind. In fact, I would say she has a ""heart"" of gold."

Only when they are merged together can they achieve true balance."" This is the first memory of Esau and Jacob, and also their doomed fate. Esau's was cheerful and simple, her pure appearance making her loved by the people; whereas Jacob was repressed and restrained, her strange black wings were disgusted by others. Such big contrasts, however, never caused them to part ways. They rely on each other like light and dark, supporting each other."
301,Esau & Jacob,Jacob's Worries,"Jacob is always frowning when you find her on the campus, not only because of her introverted personality, but also because of her troublesome sister Esau. Esau couldn't resist the curiosity to try new things, but she never thinks about the consequences. Every time she messes up, she asks Jacob for help. Even so, Jacob never really hates her sister. ""What can she do without me?"" Jacob always says with a shrug, and with that comes a smile full of happiness."
302,Esau & Jacob,Esau's Secrets,"Esau is a troublemaker, everyone in the Yume Academy knows that. Although this energetic angel was beloved by many people, they are also afraid that her naiveness may bring accidents to themselves. Does Esau know about this?

304,Raphael,School Doctor,"As is known by many, attending Yume Academy means more than studying and getting good grades. fighting is also a part of the student's everyday life. Within the Academy, Ms. Raphael, the school doctor, is in charge of the Healthcare Room. She is more than a good doctor: she is also a great listener, and her calm aura allows the girls to relax in her presence. The Healthcare Room soon became a place where the girls can talk about everything that bothers them, which also makes Raphael the best person to ask for gossip within the Academy."
305,Raphael,Potion Maniac,"Raphael was one of the Archangels in the Eastern world. However, she became interested in the arts of potion-making, and created a highly potent anesthetic. On the battlefield, all enemies that come close to her becomes paralyzed. This is, of course, not due to her Angelic powers, but due to the anesthetic that she designed. Its effects work on both enemy and ally, so don't come close unless you have taken preventative measures."
306,Raphael,The Angel respected by all,"Raphael has lived longer than many, which granted her the privilege to make fun of other angels. She was there when Michael and Gabriel arrived at the Academy, and can recall many interesting (read: embarrassing) episodes of them. While she doesn't act like it, Raphael is actually very sensitive about her age. I would suggest against mentioning her longevity when she is present, or you might find yourself trapped in a mist of poison..."

308,Mio,Relationship with Hunters,"Recently, students are spreading rumors about a girl looking like a Hunter-turned-human. However, this is not news. In fact, Mio, the subject of their discussions, arrived way earlier in this world than they did. In the past century, Mio lived with a pack of Hunters near the volcano. The reason for this is unknown. She has just started living in the Academy and seems not quite used to school life yet. Wherever she goes, there will be a large group of Hunters following her...I guess this is why everyone thought she is one of them too."
309,Mio,Talking to animals,"I often see Mio talking with animals or servants when I visit the Animal Welfare Club. Yes, I said talking ""with"", not talking ""to"". She would literally ""meow"" or ""bark"" what she wants to say, and the animals will respond with their corresponding ""language"". Soon, they would be chasing each other around. However, the only exception is Bruno. Whenever she meets Bruno, she would arch her back and tuck her tail, puffing all her hair out. Psychic is worried, but all she can do is to separate them immediately."
310,Mio,The Legend of the Volcano,"Mio told me once that the Volcano is home to the God of Flames. They breathe life to the forest and warms the animals living in it. However, evil creatures have taken this power from them. Angered by this act, they unleashed their wrath, causing the Volcano to erupt, and no one can come close to it anymore. In the legends, only the beast that is not quite a beast and the human that is not quite a human can return this power to its rightful owner. However, they will not be able to appease the God: only the hollow one and his companions will be able to soothe their fury."

312,Ithil,Perception,"Ithil was born with hypersensitivity, which enables her to notice many things in her surroundings through means other than sight. She will still be able to notice you peeping at her, even from a distance, and you will somehow feel her glaring at you, even with her eyes hidden behind a black ribbon. This ability even allows her awareness of more than whatâs physically perceivable. I believe this made her who she is today."
313,Ithil,Cleanup Master,"It's entertaining to see Ithil cleaning up the house. She can clean a room so well that you can see your own reflection in the floor. If you have at least once done housework by yourself, you will know how hard it is. But Ithil seems to enjoy the routine, as this is her method to relieving stress. We still have yet to discover where she stores all her cleaning tools..."
314,Ithil,Knife Juggler,"Ithil is undoubtedly a master of shivs--- even a bug on the wall would be a perfect target for her. Rumor is that she was once insulted by a drunkard who described her as a ""circus freak"", so Ithil taught her a lesson and shaved all her hair off as retribution."

316,n-Gen Iron Fist,Metamorphosis,"It's been a long time since I last saw Iron Fist, but she sure seems to have changed a lot. Thereâs so much about her thatâsâ¦different. Whether itâs the glittering cute antennas, the eye-catching giant robotic arm, or the smile on her face, I see signs that this once timid girl has been reborn from the inside out."
317,n-Gen Iron Fist,Prosthetic Arm,"Iron Fist's new prosthetic arm is way too large in comparison with her small figure, and keeps on knocking into people (mostly Senpai), lifting tables when everyone is eating, or causing her to lose her balance when flying in the sky. Despite all the troubles it caused her, she refuses to let go of it because of the significance it holds: with the arm, Iron Fist had protected her friends, defeat enemies that once seemed invincible, and overcome her fears."
318,n-Gen Iron Fist,A Moth...?,"""Of all the options, why a moth?"" I asked her one day. ""I don't know, "" she blushed, ""But everyone was in danger, and I had to do something, that's when the change happened. In retrospect, I probably should have chosen to become something more powerful, but I don't mind as long as I get to help."" She smiled, and her antennae bobbed up and down."

320,Fenrir,Power,"The first time I saw Fenrir, she ripped open the gate of the Academy with 2 fingers (true story). I thought I smelled danger on her from her far away. This makes me believe that no shield will be able to stop her."
321,Fenrir,Berserker,"Fenrir is a natural-born killer. You can see how she cackles with glee while swinging her giant club in battle, which is very terrifying for both her enemies and her allies. The carnage she causes just makes it even more of a game for her. I doubt she will stop fighting, even after her heart stops beating. This is the worst enemy anyone could imagine. Luckily for us, Kratos can successfully âtameâ this beast."
322,Fenrir,Dawn of the Wolf,"Fenrir once described her past as the end of the world--- âA giant wolf roars in a ring of flame, and the sanctum which once showed the glory of civilization has collapsed into ruin; in the end, there's nothing but fireâ¦â Fenrir told this story with extreme calm---- She's never been like this before. But is she the wolf in her story? Is she expecting a finale like this? I have no idea."

324,Empress Saint,D.E.F,"Since Ithil returns to the Academy, Saint transferred the position of the president of House Human to her. After that, Saint disappears without a trace. The D.E.F association, which she established, went underground. But as almost every story goes, going underground doesn't necessarily mean getting disbanded. Even without the mask, the members are still the best card player, the best marksman, and the best swordsman on campus. They are now just waiting for a chance to reassemble under the banner of a rightful ruler."
325,Empress Saint,Sword of Judgment,"Most know that Saint has a sword that never leaves her side. However, rumor goes that she has another, one that holds the power of dragons. That rumor gradually died down because no one actually saw that sword. This changed after a storm: some students claimed that they saw a huge dragon-shaped shadow on campus that night, which got the rumor mill started again."
326,Empress Saint,Dominating Power,"Rumors about Saint returning with a special power has spread all over the Academy. All who stare at her into her eyes feel like they're staring into the eyes of a monster, they'd even lose their balance as if their powers were suddenly drained out of their bodies. ""It's horrible, Saint has definitely become an evil dragon."" This is what Aquaris said when she was found lying on the ground and desperately pulling on something (which were actually Senpai's trousers) in order to overcome her fear. ""Saint caused all the destruction here! You have to trust me! She's become a complete monster!"" Of course, everyone knows Aquaris was exaggerating. But based on how much she shook, perhaps Saint really had ""impressed"" her a lot with her new power."

The most I found were records with the name ""Enigma"", but those had traces of being heavily edited. But why? I asked Kratos about this, but she only smiled mysteriously..."
329,Kratos,Regarding the Hornet,"Linky and Kratos share an interesting relationship. No matter what happens, Linky insists on following Kratos and calling her ""Master"", but her feelings (or obsessions) don't seem to be reciprocated. Kratos treat Linky the same way as she treats everyone else, and her kindness is just a disguise to her true colors. I've asked another girl (I will not reveal who she is as per her request), and she told me that nothing much has changed for them. Considering the events that have transpired in the past, this is quite unusual."
330,Kratos,The Lone Wolf,"If you look into the eyes of Kratos, you will be staggered by the emotions in them: sadness, anger, loneliness...However, she turns back to her usual kind and aloof self when she looks away. Many believe that she is alone because of her arrogance and pride as the most powerful Valkyrie. But perhaps...perhaps she is just scared to open her heart to others after everything she's been through."

Lucifer: ""I told you to let me take over the attack, donât interfere!"" Michael: ""But you're only using your dark magic. You should understand how useful the power of light is as well!"" Lucifer: ""But before your light was even used, my powers of darkness already finished the enemies!"" Michael: ""Why can't you be reasoned with... Hey! Stop it! You're never going to take over again!!! Get out of me!""\nAfter a loud noise and a flash, Lucifer gets tossed away and Michael lands on the ground with grace."
333,Nephilim,Argue about Name,"Lucifer and Michael had a discussion about what they're going to call themselves before they actually begin practicing the fusion. Although Michael and the fused consciousness both found the name ""Mifer"" acceptable, Lucifer obviously didn't like it at all, so they decided on Nephilim. I personally think that ""Mifer"" is really a good name, but this was what Lucifer said during their discussion: ""I'm not going to call myself with that ridiculous name! That name is too shameful to even be mentioned!"""
334,Nephilim,Neither Dark Nor White,"Michael---The angel who represents purity and beauty, the previous president of both the Discipline Committee and House Angel; Lucifer---The fallen angel who betrayed her comrades and raises the banner of D.E.F. Even if their fates lead them down separate paths, they are still standing together--- even more, they have combined their powers. Maybe what Lucifer once said is right: desperate times, desperate measures."

336,Krystal,Child of Miracles,"As delightful as a fairy, she suddenly appeared in the academy. She floats like a feather, her hair shines like crystal, attracting everyone's attention in one moment and then disappearing in the next. Her name does not appear on the school's enrollment list, but she is indeed among us. Rumors say that Krystal is the embodiment of miracles."
337,Krystal,Crystal Morphing,"If you're lucky enough to befriend Krystal, you might get asked for a ride one day. As for what type of ride? Sheâd turn herself into a piece of crystal and catch a ride in your backpack. But you may ask âdoesnât she fly?â and as Krystal would describe it, âflying is like carrying a dumbbell as heavy as yourself.â On a regular basis, she would rather use normal means of transport or hitch a ride with someone familiar. As to how she turns into a piece of crystal? Only those who witness will know."
338,Krystal,Miracle Light,"As a member of Yume Academy, Krystal cannot recall her past, what her name was, which academy she attended or what responsibilities she had. Itâs a complete blur to her. The only thing she can recall was her will to survive after her body had been ravaged by chaos and a burst of white light."

340,Trinity,Bizarre Clothing,"Although Trinityâs outfit isnât too strange for Yume Academy, if someone were to stare in the slightest or even ask why she was dressed like that, she would always respond âmy outfit is pretty normal.â But with her blushing face and panicked look, we can tell that she struggles to even convince herself. This aroused even more interest from students who started speculating the reason behind itâ¦ Donât ask anymore strange questions though, last I saw, her eyes were welled up with tears, so letâs just let it go."
341,Trinity,Lethargy,"Trinityâs battle suit's Optical Camouflage allows her to appear and disappear at will, while her sniper rifle allows her to quietly finish off enemies from afar. There's no doubt about Trinity's fighting ability, but... after a battle, she's always worn out, and in extreme cases, she can even doze off on the spot. On a usual basis, she always tries to get as much sleep as possible. According to Raphael's diagnosis, this seems to be a symptom caused by lack of mana, and the reason for it is probably her battle suit and her rifle. But Trinity was not surprised after hearing this, so she must have realized long ago."
342,Trinity,Tenacity,"During a crisis, Trinity was saved by Sivney, in which Sivney bestowed her with a battle suit and rifle. From that day forth, she vowed to walk in Sivneyâs footsteps. But after many years of search, she could still not find any clues to Sivney. Only when she walks into Sivney's Lab in the Academy does she feel nostalgic."

344,Rogue,Sword and Revolver,"Whilst dealing with the unpredictable sword, you have to watch out for the hidden revolver. Many students find Rogue's fighting style uncomfortable. Not to mention the deceptive and psychological tactics she uses in her battles, which can cause many students to suffer. Despite this, the students are not averse to training with Rogue - after all, it's an unfamiliar battle where you learn the most and Rogue is always sharing stories of her past as a mercenary. Just that...rumours say she's recently started charging fees? Uh, is that even possible...?"
345,Rogue,Mercenary,"Rogue is a powerful mercenary and she should have earned enough money to retire or become a reputable mercenary leader by now. But as soon as she has the money, she gambles, and with her disastrous gambling skills, she ends up in the abyss. Of course, Rogue has realized this and is determined to make amends, but the way she chose to go about it was... to cheat. After being repeatedly exposed and refusing to admit, Rogue was blacklisted at pubs and casinos, and had to wander the world in search of another place that would accept her."
346,Rogue,Trust,"In school, having mutual trust may be a natural thing. But for mercenaries, yesterdayâs comrade in arms may be today's enemy. There is no trust nor right or wrong. This is why Rogue holds a mocking attitude towards the students' relationship. However, Rogue, who holds her own life at stake, has never once bet on her sword or blade revolver. This at least shows that even Rogue has something she wants to believe in."

348,Vivian,Quirky Fortune Teller,"Fortune tellers have always given us a mysterious impression. Using misty incense, flickering candles, dreams and mysterious stars to obtain revelations only they can decipher and relay to others in an equally perplexed way. Vivian wouldâve also been of suchâ¦ quiet and mysterious nature â Only that she doesnât sit quietlyâ¦ and instantly chats to people when she gets the chance, hops off at the first sign of adventure and waves her staff aroundâ¦ Wait, is that staff used to poke people?"
349,Vivian,Voices of the Stars,"There are no islands nor lighthouses in the desert. When navigating in the endless sea of sand, the starry sky is where the heart yearns. That is why fortune-tellers often look up at the sky, looking to receive destinyâs enlightenment. Vivian looks up to the skies too, only that she never bothered to interpret the complicated star charts, and simply admires the brightness of them. The brilliance of the stars reflects in her eyes as their whispers echo in her mind."
350,Vivian,The Nature of Fortune Telling,"Although Vivianâs image is far from that of a typical fortune teller, no one doubts the accuracy of her predictions: Vivianâs predictions never fail to come true. But that causes her distress when an ominous prediction is made and the temperamental stars are never willing to explain their obscure divinations. Although Vivian is not responsible, but out of the kindness of her heart, she follows through with the outcome of her predictions till the end. But, this raises a puzzling question: Did the prophecy accurately predict reality, or did Vivian's actions lead to the prophesied outcome? And an even more bizarre speculation is: Perhaps fortune telling from the stars can alter reality?"

352,Joan,Discipline Committee,"Whenever the Disciplinary Committee is mentioned, two images pop up in mind: one of Michael, who leads by example, has good conduct and is a role model for students; the other is of Saint, menacing, aggressive and a nightmare to students. However, amongst those who stand out, there are also a few ânormalâ members â like the kind and gentle Joan, who is always wearing a calm smile. Michael exudes an unapproachable aura, while Saint is feared and avoided, thus making Joan the only one that is best with the studentsâ¦ which also begs the question whether she is therefore really a good disciplinary member. But perhaps as such, she is also one that the Disciplinary Committee cannot do without."
353,Joan,What Matters Most,"Whenever a new menu was introduced in the cafeteria or a new store opened on the shopping street, Joan was always spotted. Sheâs there on behalf of the Discipline Committee to do her check-up she would say but everyone knows in reality sheâs simply there in search of good food. But the students who opened the restaurants arenât against it, not only because of Joanâs popularity but mostly due to her reputation as a âFoodieââa reputation thatâs more effective than any publicity. However, all these things seem to be irrelevant to Joan. It is only when she is eating with Guan Yin, Sonya, and others that the smile on her face seems to become more genuine. From this, we can tell that what sheâs really after is the time spent with her companions and not actually the gourmet food."
354,But we still need to register those infected girls.It's a direct order from the president.,Holding Reservations,"Students join the Discipline Committee out of sense of duty, honor or for other specific purposes. Even though she has shown no signs of it yet, Joan must have some kind of purpose too. Some speculate that after witnessing Michael and Saintâs livelihood, she has decided to quietly support the Discipline Committee in other ways of her own. But if one day, when something she cherishes is threatened or the responsibility of the Disciplinary Committee fell on her shoulders, she would certainly change her image and step forward without hesitation."

356,Uriel,Knight of Glory,"
What is a ""knight"" like? Uriel undoubtedly best describes this word. 
Honest, kind, brave, calm, strong, and elegant. No praise would be over complimenting her. 
Especially during battle, she can create paths towards her enemies while protecting her comrades behind her. 
Seeing her strong shield and pure white wings gives the courage to conquer all dangers. 

With Urielâs years of battle experience, Hottie has specially requested for her to lead the schoolâs daily training. 
The students eventually felt uneasy after being tormented by a morning of frightening demonic training and getting told that ""this is just a warm-up exercise"". 
...... with Uriel at school, the students will definitely gain valuable experience, right?"
357,Uriel,Overloaded,"
Yet, in her daily life, Uriel doesnât seem vigorous, and instead may even seem a bit shy. 
In her spare time, she can always be seen reading silently on the bench in the shade under the trees. 
Seeing her quiet expression, she seems just like an ordinary girl, instead of the gloriously lit angel on the battlefield. 

It is only at such times that one realizes how delicate and fragile her body is underneath that armor. 
The slender fingers that hold the book, how exactly do they hold up such heavy shield and so proudly and bravely stand on the frontline?"
358,Uriel,Ray of Light,"
In the age of chaos, any ray of light is seen as a light of salvation. 
Originally, it was only to repay kindness, but unknowingly, she became the admired ""angel"" and ""knight commander"". 
Uriel\'s white wings and dazzling light undoubtedly made her seem like the savior from heaven and people could not help but look to her for salvation. 
After the fall of such a radiant angel, people\'s expectations became unendurable and difficult to bear. 
But to whom can she seek her salvation? 

Only after written those secret words in that beautiful notebook, could we see a faint smile, without concealing sadness, appearing at the corner of her mouth. 
The notebook must have been filled with warm, cherished words, as she mustâve found her ray of light too."

360,Izanami,Chaos Aftermath,"
âChaos Signs"". No one will ever forget the horrific event that affected the entire school. 
In the aftermath, most of the students gradually recovered...... and a few were left with unavoidable trauma. 
But Izanami resulted as the first serious case. 

The erosion of chaos left purple crystals on Izanami\'s face. 
With current theories, the occurrence is hard to explain and even harder to remove them. 
Therefore, Izanami had to wear a mask from time to time in order to hide the terrible traces. 

If this were the only symptom, it might not be something irreversible. 
But this was only the beginning of the tragedy."
361,Izanami,Only Thing Left,"
Izanami and Izanagi were originally a team. 
However, it is said that Izanagi left Izanami behind after she was infected by Chaos. 

This undoubtedly made Izanami fall into despair.
 She was ready to die while suffering under the painful symptoms of chaos...... 
But ironically, she overcame it and gained the ability to manipulate the chaos. 

But she had already lost all that she had, what was the point of gaining such power? 
The only goal for Izanami now is seeking the one that left her."
362,Izanami,Death God,"
""Chaos is the existence of evilâand no one doubts this. 
Therefore, one can imagine the attitude Izanami receives whilst being known to be able to control chaos.

She only wanted to seek out her lost lover, to pass through the village, why do people glare at her and even gave her the nickname of Death God.
The reasons are, of course, self-explanatory. But blinded by obsession, Izanami seems to have failed to notice this.

After being chased out of town by fists and stones, once again, Izanami sat under a tree, staring into the distance in a daze.
How long will it take me to find you?
As Izanami thought about it, it was as if an illusion appeared before her eyes and the person seemed to be right in front of her... 

No, it\'s not an illusion, the figure in front of her belongs to another person.
The woman had beautiful white hair and a gentle but cold smile on her face.
Kratos extended her hand towards Izanami."

Due to her slight tendency of being a perfectionist, even her twisted braids need to be tied up symmetrically and her knack for detail is completely on another level. She is very good at sewing, and is able to make highly detailed and intricate clothing (however, aesthetically it would be another story).\nShe loves to take care of others, and likes to secretly support them. As she thinks that germs are ânasty things that make people sickâ, she tends to clean the school on a regular basis. Her day-to-day hobby is to tidy her room.\nBecause of her tendency to worry and nag, she has become the guardian who takes care of everyone at school. But if you were to ask who is the most cared for by Vera in the school, well, that would obviously be Senpai â although that âcareâ can sometimes be said as excessive."
365,Vera,Persistence,"
Due to being known for her cleanliness at Yume Academy, she now carries the name of Perfectionist Vera. However, this trait seems to not have extended to her cookingâ¦ although her culinary skills are ready to rival that of a deadly weapon, Vera has not given up after countless attempts. After all, no matter what peculiar dish was served, Senpai always ate it with a smile, even if it was a bit forcedâ¦
The pursuit of culinary perfection only seems to stop at ""nutritious"", whereas for the appearance and tasteâ¦
âAlthough the taste may be a devastating experience, if you can survive fainting and swallow it properly, it is still highly beneficial to your bodyâ-Raphael critiques.
âAfter all, it is a lunchbox made of love and care from Vera, how could it possibly be harmful?â â Senpai critiques with a trembling voice.
It is said that Vera even consulted the school doctor, Raphael on how to make dishes that replenish energy, such as which medical herbs would be good for the body. Regarding Veraâs cooking, Raphaelâs opinion is âalthough beauty and taste are sacrificed for the sake of purpose, it is overall still a nutritional dish.â But in Veraâs own opinion, she says âHuh? I think it tastes pretty good.â But, perhaps Veraâs understanding of taste may be slightly different to everyone elseâsâ¦"
366,Vera,Cherished Moments,"The school is like a home to Vera and each student is a precious family member that cannot be replaced. Whether itâs the need to keep the environment clean or taking care of everyone, itâs just a matter of âwanting to do something for something importantâ - she just wants to take care of everything for everyone as much as she can. Each day spent at the school is a treasured moment to Vera.\nWhat Vera doesnât know is that everyone regards her as a unique and important presence to them as well. After all, itâs nice to have someone to talk to nag and yet take care of you when youâre hurt, isnât it?"

368,Apate,Urgent Notice,"If you ever come across a little poor demon girl carrying a white snake on campus, donât ever believe a word she says and run away immediately!\n\nEven though the DisciplineCommittee had issued a notice, Apateâs victims still continues to grow. For this âdemon of deceptionâ, deceiving others is her form of entertainment. Apateâs magical voice is not only pleasing to the ear, but also compelling to the mind. It is with this ability that she spreads lies and stirs up trouble, toying with innocent students in the palm of her hands. But luckily, Apateâs lying skills are not that great, if you can resist her mesmerizing tune, the lies she weaves often fall flat due to her own mistakes and making her the laughing stock of others. Yep, as long as you can resist her voiceâ¦ Oh! But when is her next concert again?"
369,Apate,Stubborn Intentions,"
Most of the time, the lies exposed from Apateâs own mistakes are laughed off by others. This, however, may also be the reason for her emotional outbursts. She was once locked up in the cold underground by angry people. It was in that dark place that she met the mysterious white snake âVolosâ who was her only companion.

As a result of her past, it seems that Apate is particularly afraid of being alone (although she would strongly deny it) and gets annoyed when ignored. Thus, it seems that Apateâs lies and deception are only to gain attention from others, as she had suffered long periods of loneliness and does not know how to treat people. For her, mischief is all that she knows of how to connect with others.

Although, even if you were to sympathize with her, there is no need to fall for her deceit, right? Even if her smile may be cute and innocent after a successful deceit (or so she thinks). But it is only a matter of time before others realize her true intentions and who knows what will happen then."
370,Apate,Becoming an Idol,"
Apate seems to have an unusual interest in becoming an idol. However, her interest is not in dancing and singing on stage, but the fanatic audience below.

It seemed to Apate that such a wild atmosphere was definitely unusual, and that some sort of special means had been used. But this thought did not discourage her, instead, to her it is the perfect profession. To Apate, an idol is an evil figure who uses words and songs to hypnotize the crowd and turn them into subordinate servants. If I could stand on that stage and sing, I could fulfill the satisfaction I had long yearned for, she thought. And so, she decided to embark on this rough journey to become the top idol.

The sight of her evil mesmerizing voice echoing across the stage is unimaginable. But aside from Apateâs misconception of an idol, itâs still a good turaroundâ¦ right?"

372,Skye,The Wind to End War,"Skye, thegirl who proclaims herself as âthe warrior of the windsâ, has always had a troubled life at Yume Academy. For some reason she is always the first to arrive at the scene of disputes and eager to âsettleâ it. By the time the disciplinary committee members arrive, both sides of the dispute would have fallen unconscious from lack of oxygen, where only the dust stirred from the whirlwind is seen drifting back down. At first, the students blamed her behavior on her impulsive and naughty nature, but after seeing her persistence on settling the issues her own way after being repeatedly being reprimanded by the Discipline Committee, they finally seem to understand that perhaps something that had happened had caused Skyeâs peculiar behavior."
373,Skye,Message of the Wind,"The wind drifts from thousands of miles away, spreading its message from afar to strange lands. However, few people are able to decipher the message of the wind, and even a sharp Ithil can only catch a singleword out of it. However, this seems to be literally ""as natural as breathing"" for Skye.\n\nSkyeâs specially modified body constantly absorbs the air around it, turning it into a weapon and at the same time, deciphering its message: grass, trees, flowers, earth, food, wild beasts, humans, magic, fire, smoke, and chaos. Among these unique ""smells"", fear and dispute are the most tormenting. That is the reason why Skye is obsessed with settling disputes, in a way, not only due to her own will, but also the instinct of her body."
374,Skye,Blood Wind,"
At the time, Sivneyâs research on magic was just about to enter a new phase, and urgently needed to her theory to be further tested by means of âhuman experimentationâ. For Sivney, the question was not a matter of whether to proceed with the human experimentation but rather of who to use for her experiment.

Eventually, she had found her answer.

When Sivney met Skye on her journey, Skye was already dying, as her body had been worn out by the long and harsh battles. Sivney immediately began her rescue mission (regardless of whether it was due to kindness or the excitement of her technological experimentation).

As a result, Skye was reborn. However, the initial injury was too severe that the body could not be recovered to its original state. With Skyeâs permission, Sivney further transformed Skyeâs body, enabling her to analyze air and extract the necessary component, although the consequence of the experimentation is yet unknown.

Thus, the wind has become like blood that flows through the body, and is as free and unrestrained as she is. The wind that sustains life, is now one of the corners of the mysterious curtain of magic that Sivney has lifted."

376,Mika,Odd Habit,"
A master of swords is the best way to describe Mika.
She was once an adventurer that traveled far and wide. In a way, she can be considered to have seen many things.
She often calls âSenpaiâ in a serious manner, believing it is necessary to address those who deserve respect politely.

Whenever she traveled to a new destination, she would carefully observe the local architectures. It started as an unintentional act that eventually developed into a habit. She would not only observe whether a building\'s construction was reasonable and strong but would also ponder about its aesthetic value. In the end, she has gone as far as to even consider its human history behind the buildings saying ""one that has not succumbed to time is of the highest value. Whether it\'s a building, a Girl, or a human being. What do you think, Senpai?"""
377,Mika,Fear,"On her adventures, Mika often does not like to let others follow behind her and insists that they walk in front.\n""Perhaps itâs because Iâm too afraid that when I turn back, all my comrades have disappearedâ¦â Her explanation tends to puzzle others. As the last master of swords, Mika's swordsmanship is highly skilled, but during battles, Mika seldom uses her sword skills and only uses magic to construct shields to protect everyone. The reason for this remains a secret."
378,Mika,A Unique Honoring,"
For a while, after joining Yume Academy, Mika was often seen creating clay dolls in a corner.
Whenever someone asked, she would simply respond that itâs only to pass time.
Only Aquaris would gently shake her head and urge others to not bother her all the time.

For Mika, creating clay dolls is her unique way of reminiscing.
While shaping the clay in her hands, she would send her condolences. In each realistic clay doll, her emotions of remorse and sorrow are expressed. However, such behavior has decreased more and more after settling into school and interacting with Senpai and her schoolmates. But perhaps for the current Mika, it is better to enjoy the present and protect everything dear to her than regretting the past."

380,Von Helsing,Friend or Foe?,"Her ruby eyes reflect pride. Thatâs right, Von Helsingâs prideful status as a vampire hunter and her persistence is engraved into her bones.\nThe vampire hunter's pride may be innate, while persistence comes from past experiences. The warmth of the villagers that she met by chance, the villagers who accepted her identity as a fighter, the villagers who fought side by side and lived together - all these beautiful existence came to a sudden end when the vampire affected by Chaos appeared. Von Helsing thus became a vampire hunter when she picked up her crossbow and pierced the vampire for the very first time. But, when she came across the immensely powerful Dracula, she was severely wounded and was on the verge of death. Out of pity or malicious mockery, Dracula gave her blood to Von Helsing who was then brought back to life but also turned her into the kind she hated most â vampires. Since then, Von Helsing has been in a state of intense self-doubt and self-hatred and to overcome the occasional urge to draw blood, Von Helsing was forced to stay away from human society."
381,Von Helsing,Contradiction,"âNever bully the weakâ thatâs what Von Helsing believes, and this is true even when dealing with opponents. And for such reason is why Von Helsing felt enraged when facing Dracula who had lost her memories, she is unclear whether this rage is due to being unable to take revenge immediately or due to some indescribable emotion. But on top of that, the current Dracula seems to be protecting Yume Academyâ¦ this has caused Von Helsing to develop a trace of hatred deep within. She does not believe that Dracula would fight for justice, nor does she believe that evil can do any good, for her own current appearance is the best source of evidence."
382,Von Helsing,"""Senpai""","Most people believe Von Helsing has a cold persona. Even if this cold distance is her way of protecting others because as long as others are too close, she would not able to hold her craving for blood. But her cold and distant personality seems to melt away every time sheâs around Senpai. Senpai seems to be the only one throughout Yume Academy to be able to make Von Helsing open up. And such is a mystery to be solvedâ¦"

384,Estel,Black Magic,"
An explosive power exists in that seemingly feeble body. That would be the right way to describe Estel.
Her firework inventions are as bold and unconventional as her character. The mage and his wife, who are dedicated to the study of magic, immediately spotted this elven girl in the orphanage, the mage and his wife gave her magic guidance and intended for her to inherit their legacy. But unfortunately, Estelâs talent for magic was not as high as her adoptive parentsâ expected.

They were stunned when Estel lit her first spark. Itâs no wonder, after all, the magic that Estel casted was not magic theyâre proud of. She prefers to stay in the lab and fiddle with all sorts of strange techniques rather than studying magic. Magic that uses scientific techniques are seen as black magic to the mage and his wife. Although they are often surprised that the so-called âblack magicâ can achieve the same effects as magicâ¦ âMagic? Itâs not that I canât do magic, itâs just that the fireworks I create are even more exceptional! And these grand fireworks can bring more joy than magic can~ Wanna see?â"
385,Estel,Dangerous Talent,"
Before coming to Yume Academy, Estel spent a long time living with her adoptive parents.
At that time, her parents were stationed in a village while on an expedition where Estel quickly became acquainted with the local children. When the adults in the village go to work, Estel was responsible for taking care of the children at home, in fact, Estel was highly popular with the kids and got along with them well. The fireworks and mini bombs she made would always soothe a crying child. During her usual lab tests, Estelâs bomb would result in shaking off a few bricks from the villagersâ roof, but that is nothing compared to the most destructive bomb sheâs ever made which was when an entire mountain collapsed to the ground. Although her inventions were harmless yet terrifying, and she sometimes created careless mistakes, she never failed to cheer up the children.

But at the end of the day, her fireworks and sparks are always controlled within a safe range."
386,Estel,Family Rule,"
Estel always carried a bag with her.
It never leaves her side, not even when she is running away at lightning speed from the scene of the crime where she was up to mischief. According to Estel, her âproof of homeâ is within it. Itâs an important promise from her important family. No one knows exactly what is in the bag beside Estel.

âWhat could be in it? Perhaps itâs a treasure map.â replies Nobunaga. For those close to Estel have noticed a habit of hers. Each time she came across a new place or found a new object, she would carefully take out a piece of paper from her bag and carefully compare, then gently circle or make a cross on the paper.

It is said that the paper is her âtreasure map listâ. As for the reason she holds this list dearly must be because once she collects all the treasure items on the list, then she is able to finally return home!"

388,Blair,Redemption from Hell,"Blair is a moth born from hell. Assassins should not have feelings. She has been taught this for as long as she can remember. But even if she didn't, she wouldn't have any ""compassion"" for anything in this world because she is a moth from hell. She is âAssassin Blair"". The world does not matter to her. âWas she born this way or did her upbringing make her this way?â This question was left unanswered before she met Senpai and still unanswered after meeting him. Everything in the world is still unimportant, and the world can still be destroyed at any time. But there is one person that even if the world was destroyed, sheâd still hope he exists and thatâ¦ is Senpai. The existence of this person is more important than the world. Like the light that shines into the darknessâ¦"
389,Blair,Assassin Skill,"Blair owns a very unique ability and that is the ability to predict. Of course, it's not the kind of divination that Vivian has, but a more practical one. For example, the ability to accurately predict the opponent's next move during a chess match, or to accurately sense changes in the weather when going out. The reason for this is that it is probably a kind of ""assassinâs hunch"", and Blairâs best ability as an assassin is to ""successfully predict her opponent's actions"" with almost 100% accuracy. This opponent however, is not limited, she can predict the weather to specific people and things. Basically, she can predict everything accurately. But this is not a natural gift, this ability comes from her fear of death. Blair hates the fear of death, and for her, ""foresight"" is an ability developed as an assassin or rather, it is so that she can survive each task given."
390,Blair,"""Promise""","If you ask Blair what kind of person she is, she will answer that she is a gentle and understanding person. Although many people don't understand her obsession with Senpai, but only Blair knows that it is because she has experienced loneliness that she understands what being alone is like. Because having given love, one knows the gentleness of love. This, is Senpai. Although the love returned by Senpai is not as special. Blair hopes that one day she can become that special person in Senpaiâs heart."

392,Holly,First Encounter,"While patrolling the surrounding forest, Senpai heard a rumor that there were fairies in the forest who often gave blessings to travelers passing by. Of course there is another version of this story that a branch will turn into a monster and capture the traveler. In order to find out the truth behind the rumor, Senpai went into the forest with Ithil to find out. If it's a monster, it would be okay, but if it's chaos, it would be a problem. With this in mind, Senpai and Ithil went to explore the forest on two separate paths. When they passed a branch, Senpaiâs top caught onto a plantâ¦ and that was their first encounter."
393,Holly,A Tribute to Love,"Holly, who is afraid of doing everything, does not know why, but as soon as she encounters love-related things, she becomes bold and romantic. She would send her blessings to people who are destined to be loved. Despite her usual stammering self, she can instantly turn into a great poetâ¦ This phenomenon still baffles Senpai and yet it is also admirable."
394,Holly,Music Theory,"Holly's flute playing has reached a high level. She thoroughly enjoys studying music theory and has great talent for music theory knowledge as well. âHelpless in sports yet talented in musicâ Kong Ming would say. What people don't know is that for this shy girl, music is the only way she can convey her feelings without words and beautiful music also brings happiness to people.

396,Teresa,Church of Violence,"The other students were apprehensive of Teresa when she first arrived at Yume Academy. The clash between her appearance and her actions were jarring: Teresa was not religious, nor gentle. She often resorted to violence instead of the bible to solve any problems. However, Teresa scoffed at this whenever anyone questions her about her conduct. To her, fighting is the best method of communication, when too many emotions cannot be expressed by words. She'd take fighting over speaking any day. ""Actions befitting a member of the Church of Violence"", as KongMing would say."
397,Teresa,Nun in Shades,"Teresa has a large collection of Sunglasses. Sunglasses on sale, sunglasses that went out of fashion, sunglasses in fashion, sunglasses that never go out of fashion, you name it, she has it. When asked about the reason behind this, she explained that she ""looks cool with them on, plus they help hide facial expressions"". Apparently, she would be an open book without them, which is ""not cool""."
398,Teresa,Nonchalance,"Teresa doesn't act like other nuns I know of. She nibbles on Spicy Fishies whenever she can, wears sunglasses 24-7, and offers protection in exchange for monetary gains. People who don't know her too well would look down upon her due to this. ""Don't judge a book by its cover"", that's what she'd say. Teresa never cares about what others say about her, as she is busy chomping on Spicy Fishies and chatting with God. ""Praying night and day? Nah, God doesn't like it when I take up all of His time..."""

To reach that dream, she has set several goals, such as becoming the most attractive villian on campus, or winning over Estel and Apate when pulling pranks. Due to her thick-headedness, she tries and fails terribly when it comes to trickery, yet she never gives up due to the same trait. This makes her the comic relief for other students in Yume Academy."
401,Frexie,...Or just an idiot?,"If you call her an idiot to her face, Frexie will probably start a fight with you. However, if you changed an approach and asked to have a prank competition with her, she would accept happily, and take everything you throw at her in the competition with a grateful smile. After falling victim to a vicious prank, she would beam at you, and thank you for ""giving her more prank ideas"". Her smile was so sincere that students would doubt whether she truly is a prankster, or is in fact an angel in disguise."
402,Frexie,"...Yes, just an idiot.","Usually, Estel is the troublemaker, Apate is the prankster, and Frexie is the victim. As for KongMing...she is in charge of cleaning up after them. Whenever Frexie is stuck on a tree or trapped somewhere, she would rush to the rescue along with Raphael.

404,Angelica,Stubbornness,"Most students' first impression of Angelica is that she is stern and proper, like a typical lady. However, an unimaginable stubbornness stays hidden behind her appearance, and others often find it hard to communicate with her. Furthermore, she is unyielding when it comes to her beliefs, even when they are proven to be wrong. The only person that can make her change her mind is probably Luna, who holds a special place in her heart."
405,Angelica,Training Habits,"Angelica is used to training in the mornings. She doesn't jog like many others do; instead, she practices archery. Day after day, she is up along with the first ray of sunlight, and is probably one of the most diligent ones in the Academy.  ""The sunlight reminds me of what I lost, so I will not forget the pain. It is carved into my soul, and I shall carry the burden for as long as I shall live."" Although none of this exists in the Academy, Angelica is still troubled by nightmares: Luna missing from her side, and the sun falling from the sky. It's hard to say whether her training is an escape from the nightmares, or she is just very self-motivated."
406,Angelica,The Moon,"Angelica and Luna used to live together in a small village. They were best partners, and their lives were peaceful. Angelica used to be weaker than Luna, so she would hide behind Luna whenever the Chaos Beasts attacked. She once believed that this will continue for eternity, until the fateful day happened. After losing Luna, Angelica traveled alone, with only the Moon to accompany her. The destination of her journey was Luna, her Moon: she vowed to meet Luna again, no matter what it will take."

408,Kassy,Cyan Flash,"Kassy is among one of the best assassins in the world. In the jungle, one can often see a figure donned in cyan, with a trace of vermilion mixed within: the cyan from her cape, while the vermilion from a bang of hair. Although Kassy has feline agility, she isn't as curious as a cat. Unlike other assassins who tend to torture their targets (such as Blair), Kassy is not interested in anything outside of her jungle. She does a clean job of finishing off the targets, and gets the job done three times faster than others. This makes her famous among assassins. She is called the Cyan Flash: her speed is matchless, and a flash is all you will see of her when she passes you."
409,Kassy,Style of Assassination,"Contrary to Blair, who gives effort in honing her skills, Kassy never bothered too much about improving her skills. There is no point: just like a cat, she instinctively knows how to hunt. However, just like Blair, she has her distinct style of assassination. Kassy will never torture her target to death; she ends everything with one lethal blow. She believes that this is the best way to pay respect to all lives: human, monster, and Chaos Beast alike."
410,Kassy,(Unnecessarily) Hurt Pride,"Kassy works best in the jungle: she hides among the trees, waits until the target comes into range, then deals the killing blow. However, she finds it hard to replicate this after arriving at Yume Academy. Kassy is irritated that she can't hunt as well as Blair now that she has left the jungle she thrives in. While she isn't interested in killing, she doesn't like losing to Blair, who she always looked down upon."

She sometimes rewinds the hands of her watch out of curiosity just to let people reunite with their deceased loved ones. But one will always wake from their dream. As she gains and loses, and sees people laughing and crying, Monica began to find other pleasures. The human soul. Their civilization. Nothing lasts forever in this world and eventually everyone will disappear and turn to ash. However, only the feelings created by the human soul continue to shine forever, just like the stars in the night sky..."

For unknown reasons, Monica was particularly fond of old-fashioned pendulum clocks.

416,Diana,Interdependent,"The sun and the moon were meant to be interdependent. When the sun rises, the moon sets, like a natural order to the world. That is why Diana believed that her relationship with Apollis would last forever. Had it not been for that inexplicable natural disaster, perhaps she would not have been separated from Apollis at all. Still, Diana believes Apollis is alive, even if her whereabouts are unknown. -""As long as the sun is there, Apollis is surely alive. She must be waiting for me to find her."""
417,Diana,Seeking for the Sun,"Diana's search for Apollis continues and she hasn't changed her mind even after entering Yume Academy. Even though Diana's memory had started to blur, but her faith to find Apollis never diminished, for they are forever bounded by blood. Someday, the two lost souls will reunite with the guidance of the stars."
418,Diana,Guardian of the Stars,"Diana has a secret hobby of stargazing. Although she does not have Vivian's ability of divination. Every night, when looking up at the vast starry sky, Diana's mood would still be much calmer. It seems that as long as you look up at the stars, you can feel the presence of Apollis. Diana is essentially a pacifist, she does not like to fight, nor does she like to fight with Chaos. But every time she faces Chaos, she will go forward to fight without hesitation, because - ""Only by guarding this starry sky, I can be guided by the stars and reunite with Apollis once again."
