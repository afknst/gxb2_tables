1,Kaleidoscopic Humans,"Monica knows how the God of Time feels about most beings in the world, but she doesn't know what is their opinion of her. She was their daughter, but an aimless wanderer at the same time. Even if she has the power to control time, time still flows past her fingers, and endings come faster than she expected. Even after witnessing the rise and fall of kingdoms and the passings of seasons, she still doesn't understand human beings. What makes a human, and what will a human become? She used to compare the human heart to a kaleidoscope: the patterns change when you peer upon it from a different angle."
2,Returning to her Roots,"Monica is interested in human beings. What do Gods mean to humans? They tend to believe that everything happened due to the will of Gods, as if they are the only entities leading the way. However, the students of Yume Academy believed otherwise, and the shared belief tightened the bonds among them. This discovery was a pleasant surprise for Monica, who believed she lost her roots when she traveled, and she decided to stay. She believes that something transcends time, and that something has nothing to do with the Gods."
