The rifle that Trinity uses is an artificial Antique developed by the legendary inventor, Sivney. That explains the unknown technologies applied during its development.

The rifle is built without the need for a magazine. In fact, the rifle runs on mana and can directly absorb from its user, shooting from its chamber after some compression, the magnitude of the shots are incredible. But still, it’s not a wonder weapon after all, overusing it will cause the owner to become sleepy or have a headache due to constant mana loss. So proper ""ammunition"" management is still needed when using this weapon.

Trinity is oblivious about these side-effects, even though she’s been equipped with it for such a long time. But still, she refuses to give it up, it must be due to her admiration for Sivney … or her being nice than wise."

The crystal vial used by Raphael, the Angel of Healing. This vial contains a potion prepared by Raphael that glows faintly through the crystal. Its delicate shape is like jewelry, but it’s more than a mere decoration with its magic. 

The vial is made of crystal to preserve the magic power of the potion that Raphael has prepared through her magic. When Raphael injects her magic directly into the vial, the medicine will form a thick mist that fills the vial. It is said that Raphael\'s holy light radiates softly in the mist, which is holy and tranquil. 

Her magic can stimulate the activity of living creatures. This ability allows Raphael to create life-saving elixirs, but it can also be used to create horrific poisons, making her one of the most fearsome of all time. However, she only uses it to save lives, even as a drug, it is only used for surgery. Perhaps this is also due to her faith and gentleness. The bottle contains a reassuring warmth due to her magical powers, so be careful not to become addicted."

Apate’s impression of an idol was based on rumors that resulted in her misunderstanding of the term. The staff is derived from the idea that the idol is an evil character that uses songs to mesmerize the crowd, allowing Apate\'s songs to emanate from it, greatly enhancing her ability to compel the mind. Despite Apate’s misunderstanding, the two seem to have achieved the same effect in terms of results: creating a fantasy for people to voluntarily indulge.

Even if you know it is a fantasy, the happiness you get from it is still real, right?"

Over time, people who see this weapon think that the whispers are like the call of death, and the mere presence of it sends shivers down their spine.

So proper ""ammunition"" management is still needed when using this weapon.

The blade Iron Fist gets after her prosthetic arm evolved in the journey. This is surely an evidence that Sivney has knowledge about technology Yume doesn’t have.

Even in darkness and despair, Iron Fist never gave up hope. Thus the prosthetic arm is influenced by her iron will and evolved to a stronger form.

These blades have gone through thick and thin with Iron Fist. She feels confident and safe in any ordeal, with her trusty weapon."

67121,Sacred Vial,,"
The crystal vial used by Raphael, the Angel of Healing. This vial contains a potion prepared by Raphael that glows faintly through the crystal. Its delicate shape is like jewelry, but it’s more than a mere decoration with its magic. 

The vial is made of crystal to preserve the magic power of the potion that Raphael has prepared through her magic. When Raphael injects her magic directly into the vial, the medicine will form a thick mist that fills the vial. It is said that Raphael\'s holy light radiates softly in the mist, which is holy and tranquil. 

Her magic can stimulate the activity of living creatures. This ability allows Raphael to create life-saving elixirs, but it can also be used to create horrific poisons, making her one of the most fearsome of all time. However, she only uses it to save lives, even as a drug, it is only used for surgery. Perhaps this is also due to her faith and gentleness. The bottle contains a reassuring warmth due to her magical powers, so be careful not to become addicted."

67241,Deception,,"
A staff used by the demon of deception, Apate. Its weapon appearance is just like the “idol” who wields it on the battlefield or “stage”.

Apate’s impression of an idol was based on rumors that resulted in her misunderstanding of the term. The staff is derived from the idea that the idol is an evil character that uses songs to mesmerize the crowd, allowing Apate\'s songs to emanate from it, greatly enhancing her ability to compel the mind. Despite Apate’s misunderstanding, the two seem to have achieved the same effect in terms of results: creating a fantasy for people to voluntarily indulge.

Even if you know it is a fantasy, the happiness you get from it is still real, right?"

67301,Reaper's Voice,,"
The weapon used by the cold-blooded reaper, Scythe. It was originally an ordinary scythe, but after many harvesting, the blade gathered many sorrows of the dead, like an embodiment of death itself.

The souls harvested by this scythe could not be freed and after a long time, they wandered and whispered around it. Not only was Scythe unafraid of them, she even enjoys this “sound of music”. Over time, people who see this weapon think that the whispers are like the call of death, and the mere presence of it sends shivers down their spine.

You better not look at this scythe for too long, for you might just hear the voices of death too."

It is a revolver gun with a blade attached to the barrel. The enemies of Rogue could never tell whether they will be stricken down with a bullet to the temple or a severed head.

Sivney created this to cool the room during summer but accidentally made it into a power Antique. It was later gifted to Aurora, the Queen of the Northlands, who used it to restore balance to the Northlands. 

In the past, her Kingdom was once deeply affected by Chaos, causing its glaciers to melt and forcing its ecosystem to the brink of collapse. However, with this Antique, Aurora managed to restore balance to the Northlands, making it one of the most valued artifacts in her Kingdom.
