1,,,The scent of the ocean breeze tingled my nostrils as the radiant sun reflected a dazzling gold across the beach.,
2,,,Anyone that had this scene in sight would feel at peace… apart from me.,
3,,,and you will understand why…,
4,,,"Face burning red from the sun, eyes shut in agony from the harsh sunbeam and a mix of tears and sweat cascading down like waterfall.",
5,,,"Of course, I could leave this tragedy by finding a shady spot.",
6,,,But that's if I could leave…,
7,,,"At this moment, things are starting to get worse as a tiny crab approaches, staring eye level at me.",
8,,,"Subconsciouly I wanted to chase it away, but then I was reminded that I am unable to move my limbs.",
9,,,…that's right. Everything below my neck is currently buried in sand besides my head.,
10,,,"The crab is approaching menacingly as it swings its oddly shaped pincers and spiky feet, tramping over a photo laying on the sand on its way over.",
11,,,So small and yet so scary…,
12,,,How did it get to this point…,
13,,,"On a hot summer's day,",
14,,,as the heat distracted the students from studying and training and in order to lift their spirits,
15,,,the Student Union had taken the lead to organise a beach holiday.,
16,,Esau,Jacob! Jacob! It's the ocean!,
17,,Jacob,Oh... I've never seen the ocean before.,
18,,Chevalir,"Hahaha, I was also surprised the first time I saw it. I never knew anything more vast than the grassfield existed.",
19,,Chevalir,I heard Tech Guild has developed vehicles that can speed on ocean...  Maybe I should borrow one of them.,
20,,*,Why am I not surprised...,
21,,*,Someone has arrived before us and even opened a store.,
22,,Chevalir,This was also planned by of Student Union. They've prepared a lot for this trip.,
23,,Hottie,"Alright, now is the time to put on your swimsuits.",
24,,Ithil,"The locker room is right over there, let's head over.",
25,,Valeera,I'll set up a barrier to prevent Senpai from peeping~,
26,,*,I'm not a pervert!,
27,,*,(But I'm really looking forward to see everyone in their swimsuits...),
28,,*,(Well... I guess I can take a walk in the meantime),
29,,*,Huh...? Amelia's Divination?,
30,,Amelia,Senpai... Do you want to know your fortune?,
31,,*,But I don't see your crystal ball... Don't tell me you're going to use this beach ball.,
32,,Amelia,"No problem, any transparent ball can do.",
33,,*,Seriously!?,
34,,Amelia,Here we go...,
35,,,Boom!,
36,,Amelia,…………,
37,,*,…………,
38,,,The beach volleyball exploded after a loud noise.,
39,,*,Uh... Are you alright?,
40,,Amelia,"Senpai... You will be unlucky today, please be careful.",
41,,Amelia,Now I should go and get myself a new beach volleyball...,
42,,*,…………,
43,,,The sound of waves crashing reached my ears before I could gather my thoughts.,
44,,,"At that moment, I didn't know what I would be facing.",
45,,Ithil,What's wrong? Why are you staring into space?,
46,,*,Oh...  Ithil...,
47,,*,…………,
48,,Ithil,Why are you still staring? Is there something on my face?,You look nice.|The swimsuit suits you a lot.
49,,Ithil,Are you starstruck? If you're so free then come and assist me with the store.,
50,,*,You're operating a store too? But why do I still need to do hard labour on my holiday…,
51,,,Ithil is running a food store and was even supplied with ingredients and an ice-cream maker from the Student Union.,
52,,,I never knew that they were so generous... Is it because it's Ithil?,
53,,*,Phew... That was exhausting.,
54,,Ithil,Thanks for your help.,
55,,*,You made this for me?,
56,,Ithil,There isn't a third person here.,
57,,*,Now I feel that my hardwork was worth it.,
58,,Ithil,I see... Maybe you can get paid with an ice-cream for every hard labour you're going to do in the future?,
59,,*,"No no no... I'm fine, thank you...",
60,,Valeera,"Oh, that's rare, Senpai isn't lazing about.",
61,,,Looks like the girls have put on their swimsuits.,
62,,*,…………,
63,,Valeera,Senpai? Why are you staring into space?,
64,,*,No… It just feels like there's nothing exciting to expect.,
65,,Valeera,"... Sound harsh, but it can't be argued…",
66,,Valeera,"Anyways, I'm going to enjoy the beautiful beach view.",
67,,Valeera,"Ithil, I'd like an ice cream please~!",
68,,Ithil,"Alright, here you go.",
69,,Valeera,"Ithil is always so kind. Senpai, you shouldn't let her overwork.",
70,,*,But I was actually the one that did all the hardwork...,
71,,Turin,Senpai! How is my swimsuit!,
72,,*,Well... I'd say it's kind of different from the others.,
73,,Turin,"I searched it up! It's called Sukumizu, this style is rumored to be very popular amongst students!",
74,,*,We even have this kind of data in our database?,
75,,Hexa,"It's true, I also found similar data.",
76,,Hexa,"But upon closer inspection, I found that the source and information of whoever that posted it was erased. Now I can't recover it....",
77,,Hexa,There's a suspicious aura about it…,
78,,Turin,"Actually... Within the data, there's a familiar style presence...",
79,,*,"Oh, since you've mentioned it, I probably know who the author is...",
80,,Turin,Oh! Iron Fist is coming out! Over here!,
81,,Iron Fist,Senpai... Do I look strange in this?,
82,,*,……,Not at all|It suits you a lot
83,,Iron Fist,Haha... Thanks...,
84,,Turin,"We're heading to the beach, are you coming with us?",
85,,*,Well...,
86,,Ithil,Don't worry about me. I won't need your help anymore.,
87,,*,But aren't you coming with us?,
88,,Ithil,Someone's gotta watch over the store... And... I can handle this alone.,
89,,*,Okay... We're leaving now then. I'll return and take over later!,
90,,Ithil,Whatever you say.,
91,,*,... I didn't think it could be this tiring...,
92,,*,"I can understand that Turin isn't tired since she's an AI, but Hexa and Iron Fist...",
93,,*,... There seems to be someone even more hyper...,
94,,Lucifer,Hahaha! Is that all the waves can do?,
95,,Lucifer,It's really fun to surf!,
96,,Michael,Hey! Lucifer! You almost hit someone!,
97,,Michael,"Senpai, please stop her from getting herself into trouble and get her away from the crowd.",
98,,Michael,I thought she could get along on this trip.,
99,,Michael,But how can she achieve that by surfing alone!,
100,,Michael,"When exactly did she learn to surf? I hope she didn't skip classes and come here alone. It's really dangerous, I should also mention that next time...",
101,,Michael,"... Senpai, are you listening?",
102,,*,"Huh...!? Oh yes, that's right, I think you've made your point.",
103,,Michael,... But where were you looking at...,
104,,Michael,Uh... I shouldn't have asked Raphael for help when picking my swimsuit...,
105,,Raphael,"Wow, this swimsuit is so cute with a skirt design...! But I think you might look better in a  traditional design.",
106,,Raphael,Oh! And look at this one...  Maybe you can choose the sexier one...,
107,,Raphael,"So, Michael, which one do you prefer? Or perhaps we can get them all?",
108,,Raphael,"But of course, you should try them on first!... Come here, let me help you.",
109,,Michael,"No... I mean, Raphael…it's a hassle, we can just choose any.",
110,,Raphael,It's not a hassle at all! There's plenty to go around... We've got 82 swimsuits to try on…,
111,,Michael,...! Sorry but I need to go now! I've got work to do! I''ll just take this one!,
112,,Raphael,"Hey, Michael! Wait!",
113,,Raphael,It's a pity that I cannot go with them.,
114,,Raphael,But maybe I can...,
115,,Michael,I should've checked which swimsuit I took from Raphael...,
116,,Gabriel,Michael! Look over here!~,
117,,,Click!,
118,,Michael,！？,
119,,Gabriel,Hahaha! This one's not bad!,
120,,Michael,Gabriel... How can you take someone's photo without their permission...! Delete it now!,
121,,Gabriel,"Don't get mad. This is a direct order from Raphael. You know, no one dares to refuse that old ha... I mean that beautiful woman.",
122,,Gabriel,"Besides, if you don't want to show it to others, you shouldn't have worn it. Let's take some more.",
123,,,"Click, click, click!",
124,,Gabriel,Now this is enough to publish a photo albm!,
125,,Michael,You're not getting away this easily!!! Stay where you are!!!!,
126,,Gabriel,"Oh no...! Senpai, catch!",
127,,*,Huh? Me?,
128,,,"Before I could react, a black camera landed in my hand.",
129,,Michael,Senpai…,
130,,,A threatening smile grew on Michael's face.,
131,,*,Oh... What do you want...?,
132,,Michael,Give me that camera,
133,,*,…………,Of course|No
134,,Michael,"Well done, that's what a Senpai should do.",
135,,Michael,"Senpai, are you feeling pitiful about it?",
136,,Michael,…………,
137,,Michael,I see... Taking photos during a trip is crucial.,
138,,Michael,Maybe we can take a photo together some time later today.,
139,,,"With the camera in her hand, Michael soon realizes that she doesn't have any pocket to keep it in.",
140,,Michael,... I guess I will leave it to you... For now.,
141,,Michael,Senpai... But don't take any chances!,
142,,Michael,Now it's time for me to take down the person responsible for this...,
143,,Michael,"... Senpai, what are you doing this for?",
144,,Michael,Do you want my photo this badly?,
145,,Michael,…………,
146,,Michael,I won't disagree if you want to take photos of me... But...,
147,,Michael,"Nevermind... Just keep this camera for now, I've got something more important to do...",
148,,,Click!,
149,,Gabriel,Hohoho! All perfessional reporters would bring a backup camera with her!,
150,,Michael,Gabriel!!!!!,
151,,*,……,
152,,,"Staring at the object of crime, lost in thought.",
153,,*,What should I do with this...,
154,,Esau,Jacob! Come down! Let's swim some more!,
155,,Jacob,But... I think we should put on some sunscreen in case we get sunburnt.,
156,,Esau,"Not bad! I knew I could rely on you, Jacob! Let me help you too!",
157,,Jacob,"Ok, we're done, now to rub on the front.",
158,,Esau,No....,
159,,Jacob,...?,
160,,Esau,I can't eat anymore...,
161,,Jacob,She's fallen asleep!?,
162,,Hottie,Silly... You'll be over-exhausted if you keep playing without rest.,
163,,Hottie,Pour yourself a cup of wine and enjoy the sun on the beach.,
164,,Hottie,That's what you should do if you want to finish this trip in style.,
165,,*,I hope nobody learns from the bad example...,
166,,*,???,
167,,,"While they were playing in the water, a figure watched from the a distance on shore.",
168,,Phoenix,…………,
169,,*,"Phoenix, why don't you go and join them?",
170,,Phoenix,Senpai? Well... I just felt a bit tired from swimming.,
171,,,However she didn't seem to have swam as there were absolutely no water droplets on her.,
172,,*,So... You don't know how to swim.,
173,,Phoenix,……！？,
174,,Phoenix,No!!! Of course I can swim! Swimming is an easy skill that all Valkyries can...,
175,,*,……,
176,,Phoenix,…………,
177,,Phoenix,Okay... I cannot swim.,
178,,Phoenix,It was never a need! You don't need to worry about the terrain as long as you can fly.,
179,,Phoenix,"Even if I fall into water by accident, I can still create steam from the water to take off…",
180,,Phoenix,Why should I spend my effort on a useless skill?,
181,,Phoenix,"But they all seem so happy, I wish I could play with them.",Teach Phoenix how to swim
182,,*,"Honestly, I'm also not good at swimming. Now I feel that I'm not alone.",
183,,*,Maybe we can practice together?,
184,,Phoenix,"Oh, in this case I think I can help you!...",
185,,*,Phoenix! Straighten your body!,
186,,Phoenix,I'm trying!,
187,,*,"Wait... You're moving your legs too fast, that would make you lose balance.",
188,,Phoenix,"But if I kick slower, I'd be left behind!",
189,,*,Phoenix? Are you alright? It's been awhile since you've surfaced…,
190,,Phoenix,(Gasps)... I thought I was dying...,
191,,Valeera,"Huh? Phoenix playing with Senpai... That's rare, mind if you tell me what you guys are doing...",
192,,*,"Valeera? As you can see, we're practicing how to swim.",
193,,Phoenix,…………,
194,,Valeera,Oh! What a coincidence! I cannot swim either!,
195,,Valeera,My tail isn't waterproof like your wings. It gets heavy in water...,
196,,Valeera,And my body proportion is not ideal for sports...,
197,,*,That's... really sad...,
198,,Valeera,But I can create a giant floating ice and use wind magic to push it and that'll allow me to move around on water. So it's not too bad.,
199,,Valeera,"But I'm heading off now, enjoy yourselves~",
200,,Valeera,"By the way... Phoenix, you're not swimming now, but why are you still holding Senpai's hand?",
201,,Phoenix,…………！！,
202,,*,"Wait... Phoenix, it's not safe to go under water... HOT!!!",
203,,*,HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHOT!... Phoenix...!!! You're heating up the water around us!!???,
204,,Valeera,My ice is melting!!! Somebody help!!!,
205,,Phoenix,Sorry... I just got nervous and....,
206,,*,Thank God nothing serious happened...,
207,,Valeera,I just lost my ice cream... Guess I need get a new one from Ithil.,
208,,Phoenix,Senpai... Maybe we can practice this again... Some time later?,
209,,*,"Of course, so that you will be able to join the others next time we have this kind of trip again!",
210,,Phoenix,... Thank you.,
211,,Phoenix,(Actually…it's not about swimming with everyone else but...),
212,,*,Alright... Time to rest for a bit.,
213,,*,What's happening over there?,
214,,Chevalir,No way! I won't sell you anything anymore! You must have cheated!,
215,,CapsuGirl,That's pretty lame! How can you blame someone for her luck!,
216,,Gambler,"That's right! We didn't cheat, we won it with our skills.",
217,,Chevalir,Now that sounds fake!,
218,,*,What's happening...?,
219,,Chevalir,"Senpai, maybe you can help me out... I marked a sign in some of the caps of the soda bottles I sell and whoever wins can get a free soda.",
220,,Chevalir,"It was designed to surprise students, but…",
221,,Chevalir,These two girls here... They've won consecutively more than 8 and 12 times! That seems suspicious!,
222,,CapsuGirl,"That's completely acceptable when it comes to me. According to the estimation, I can still win another 30 consecutive times.",
223,,Gambler,"Stop bragging, you know I can do the same.",
224,,CapsuGirl,Then what about a match? The one who wins the prize 50 times will win!,
225,,Gambler,Huh? Interesting... It's been a long time since the last student challenged me. I hope you've brought something to bet.,
226,,Chevalir,LEAVE AT ONCE!!!,
227,,*,There seems to be a commotion... What's happening?,
228,,Valeera,"Hey! Senpai, we're having a Suikawari match right now. And I'm the referee for the game!",
229,,*,I can tell... Your proportion is stopping you from being a player...,
230,,Valeera,Senpai! If you keep being mean... I'll tell Ithil!,
231,,Phoenix,Huh... A match? This should be a good chance...,
232,,Phoenix,"I didn't do well on water, but now I am on land, I can surely...",
233,,Valeera,Oh! We've got our first volunteer! Come over and start the preparation!,
234,,Phoenix,Huh? We have to wear blindfolds?,
235,,Phoenix,Why are you making me spin around!!!?,
236,,*,So you didn't know the rules...,
237,,Phoenix,Why is there such a game!!!,
238,,Phoenix,Oh no... I've lost my sense of direction... Where am I? Where should I go?? Where's the watermelon!!??,
239,,Valeera,Phoenix... Out...,
240,,Phoenix,This is so embarrassing!!! I wish I could dig a hole big enough to bury myself…,
241,,Valeera,Coming up next... Hexa!!!,
242,,Valeera,"As per the rules, you can only rely on instructions given by others! Things like sonar and locator are forbidden!",
243,,Hexa,"Only relying on instructions? Sure, I've got it.",
244,,Valeera,Here we go!,
245,,Hexa,Hya!!!,
246,,*,It's so easy for her.,
247,,Phoenix,She's out of my league...,
248,,*,But how is Hexa locating the watermelon so quickly and accurately?,
249,,Hexa,That's because Turin sent me simulated images online...,
250,,*,"That's literally not breaking the rules Valeera made, but...",
251,,Turin,Huh? Why can't I do that? Kratos said that everyone can do this trick.,
252,,Valeera,... Cheat!,
253,,Hexa,So basically all technological methods are forbidden...,
254,,Turin,What a pity...,
255,,*,Haha... Everyone's really enjoying themselves.,
256,,*,(It's about time for me to get back and help Ithil),
257,,Ithil,Welcome back. Hope you had fun.,
258,,*,"It's been rough, I'm more tired than I was in class, but I'm quite happy.",
259,,Ithil,That's what we call a trip that's worth it!,
260,,*,You should've joined in.,
261,,Ithil,"Perhaps next time I will. But I must say, I was actually enjoying myself while preparing ice-cream for others.",
262,,*,Since you've mentioned it... I should take over. You should rest for a while.,
263,,Ithil,Sure... Just don't ruin the reputation I've built.,
264,,*,"I can't make ice-cream like you, but I've also got a secret recipe.",
265,,Ithil,"Sure, good luck then! I'm taking a break.",
266,,*,Leave it to me!,
267,,*,"(…Yea, the holiday should be ending without any incidents.)",
268,,*,(But I still feel a bit cautious...),
269,,*,(Amelia's Devination said that I would have a bad day...),
270,,*,(How bad is that going to be?),
271,,*,"By the way, Ithil. I've got a question...",
272,,*,... Ithil?,
273,,*,... Ithil?,
274,,Ithil,…………,
275,,*,She's... Asleep...?,
276,,*,A rare sight to see she fell asleep so defensively. She's definitely tired.,
277,,,"Lying on a beach chair, Ithil breathes gently as her silver hair shimmers under the sunlight.",
278,,*,…………,
279,,,"Oh yes, I still have Gabriel's camera...",
280,,,It's quite tempting to take a photo of her whilst sleeping.,
281,,,But should I?,"No, I cannot do something that is not that impolite.|No, I'd die for this."
282,,,I decided not to disturb her and was preparing to leave.,
283,,Ithil,... ???,
284,,,The sound of movements woke Ithil and suddenly she opened her eyes just in time to catch me holding the camera.,
285,,*,…………,
286,,Ithil,…………,
287,,Ithil,"You know I won't let you leave that easily with this in your hand, right?",
288,,*,Wait… I can explain.,
289,,Ithil,Hand over the camera or you will be...,
290,,Ithil,sorry!,
291,,*,…………！！？？,
292,,,"Some time must've passed till I woke up. Everyone has left the beach, whereas for me…",
293,,,my body is deeply buried in sand.,
294,,*,But... I'm innocent…!,
295,,*,Anybody out there...? HELP!!!,
296,,Gabriel,"Oh, Senpai... Sorry about that.",
297,,,The person responsible had finally shown up.,
298,,*,Hey! You!,
299,,Gabriel,"But, I should say that I'm impressed.",
300,,Gabriel,Nobody is daring enough to take candid photos of Ithil... Maybe I should learn more from you.,
301,,*,That's not what actually happened... And please get me out of here.,
302,,Gabriel,"Sorry, I don't want to upset Ithil.",
303,,Gabriel,But you can take this as my apology gift.,
304,,Gabriel,"Ta-da! It's a nice one, isn't it?",
305,,,It was a photo of Michael in her swimsuit... I have to admit it's a nice one.,
306,,*,Take it back... I don't want this...,
307,,Gabriel,At least you won't be lonely.,
308,,Gabriel,"It's time for me to go, Ithil has already started the preparations dinner.",
309,,Gabriel,"Don't worry, I'll save some food for my partner in crime.",
310,,*,"I'm not your partner! Hey, wait! I can admit I'm your partner if you can somehow loosen the sand...",
311,,*,…………,
312,,,Guess I won't get any response from her any time soon.,
313,,,"Well, that's what happened.",
314,,,And now the crab in front of me has become my biggest issue...,
315,,,So I closed my eyes and prayed that the crab wouldn't do anything terrible...,
316,,,"But after a long while, the feeling of a crab trampling upon me did not occur.",
317,,Iron Fist,"Little crab, go play elsewhere, it's very dangerous here.",
318,,,A familiar voice appeared,
319,,*,I knew... I knew you'd come for me... Iron Fist.,
320,,Iron Fist,Of course I would! I believe you wouldn't do such a terrible thing.,
321,,*,Absolutely! I wouldn't even dare to think of it! Just get me out of here!,
322,,Iron Fist,But... Ithil said that you still have 3 hours to bear.,
323,,*,I could tell she was angry this time…,
324,,Iron Fist,"Nonetheless, she told me to bring you this ice-cream.",
325,,Iron Fist,I think Ithil isn't fully upset about it... But rather about something else... I'm not too sure.,
326,,Iron Fist,But let's leave this in the past and finish this ice-cream before it melts.,
327,,*,But as you can see...,
328,,Iron Fist,"Ah... Of course. Let me feed you, Senpai. Open your mouth~",
329,,,"The rich, sweet, creamy flavor spreaded in my mouth, melting away all my pain.",
330,,,This is the best thing I've had today.,
331,,,Iron Fist stops suddenly as a thought occurred.,
332,,Iron Fist,"... Senpai, may I ask you a question?",
333,,*,Uh? What question?,
334,,,"As she spoke, she picked up something thin on the beach.",
335,,Iron Fist,What is this?,
336,,,It was the photo of Michael in her swimsuit...,
337,,*,…………,
338,,,Is it too late to explain?,
339,,,--- I hate Gabriel,
