28,,Mysterious Person B,Sorrrrrryyyy ---- K----,
29,,Mysterious Person A,Stop it. Apologizing won't solve the matter now. Luckily I threw the card at Skye when she was pursuing us. Guess it's a good ending to our peculiar thieving aesthetic right?,
30,,Mysterious Person B,"(Then again, it's less of a notice than a crime declaration.)",

119,,,What does she mean by catching thieves?,
120,,*,You… you lost your necklace too?,
121,,Rogue,"Honestly, you keep saying things that I don't understand--- I'm talking about the chocolates! THE CHOCOLATES! The chocolates for the chocolate contest are stolen!",

130,,,... Stolen… Who can be so unethical!,
131,,,Whoever steals Valentine's Day chocolates is a public enemy!,
132,,,That's right!,

134,,,"And just like that, this miserable day has ended.",
135,,,"Time for bed, perhaps things will be better tomorrow.",
136,,*,From what I recall,
137,,,I would encounter Rogue next,

141,,Rogue,Stop right there!,

150,,,This is too confusing,
151,,,Maybe all my worries will go away after a good night's rest.,
152,,,"And so, with disappointment and bewilderment",
153,,,I went back to my dormitory.,
154,The Doctor's Kindness,Raphael,"Today's a special day, you shouldn't be sighing. It's bad luck to sigh, you know.",
155,,*,It's just too depressing.,
156,,Raphael,"Oh, you're just complimenting me to make me smile, aren't you?",
157,,*,"No, it's not that. I just feel relieved seeing you.",
158,,Raphael,"I see. Thank you, that makes me rather happy.",
159,,*,---,
160,,Raphael,What counts as Valentine's Day to you?,
161,,Raphael,"Speaking of which, Valentine’s Day at Yume Academy is also quite the tradition. Although this day was taken from the book.",
162,,Raphael,"During this time of the year, we would create our activities, even if it seems like a replication, these activities have successfully brought happiness to everyone.",
163,,*,(Raphael is highly knowledgeable),
164,,Raphael,"Well, I am one of the older seniors that have been here for a while. I am quite familiar with the school’s history.",
165,,*,"(Well, she doesn't seem old to me at all)",
166,,*,"Ah, this is?",
167,,,Tiny unwrapped candies are scattered on the table.,
168,,,The size is small and the shape is irregular,
169,,,"But judging from the shape, without a doubt, it's chocolate.",
170,,Raphael,"Oh, I made these.",
171,,Raphael,But I think they're a little melted.,
172,,*,Raphael can make things other than medicine…,
173,,*,Raphael can make... food… and even chocolate…,
174,,*,And well-made chocolates at that!,
175,,Raphael,Wait! Don't --,
176,,Raphael,…eat that!,
177,,Raphael,Ah… Guess I'm too late.,
178,,*,But it tastes great! Mmmm…,
179,,*,(Chews chews chews),
180,,*,It suddenly became tasteless… It was sweet just now…,
181,,Raphael,"It’s chocolate made with a powerful nutritional solution. To maximize its medical effects, I’ve specifically used a lot of new ingredients to create it.",
182,,*,……,
183,,Raphael,"Senpai, are you okay? You don't look too well.",
184,,*,I...,"I'm completely fine, don't worry.|Raphael, I don't think I'm feeling well."
185,A Chaotic Day,Raphael,"Senpai, you don’t have to force yourself! Or at least don’t pose in a batting stance… Why baseball anyways?",
186,,*,i can do it---!,
187,,Raphael,"Ah, please wait! Don't move around too much --- Watch out!",
188,,,Smash---,
189,,*,"Why is the world suddenly spinning, is this… part… of the… side… effects… It's… pretty… strong…",
190,,,Thud (Hits the ground),
191,,Zoe,"Whew, it's a lot safer after tranquilizing him. Raphael, are you all right?",
192,,Raphael,A heavy nutritional solution and a tranquilizer…,
193,,Raphael,I'm not sure that his body can handle it.,
194,,Zoe,Luckily I just got here in time. You can leave the rest to me. I'll get him settled in a bed.,
195,,Raphael,What was the dosage of the tranquilizer?,
196,,Zoe,"Not a lot, but I added some sleep drug in it as well. Seemed pretty effective.",
197,,Raphael,Looks like Senpai might sleep for a whole day then.,
198,,,……,
199,,*,Ahhhhhhhh!,
200,,*,(It's already nine-thirty in the evening? I've slept through an entire precious Valentine's Day!),
201,,Raphael,"It's all right, stay calm…",
202,,*,"Not only have I passed out for an entire day, but I'm even on a hospital bed!",
203,,*,Not even having fallen asleep on Raphael's soft knees. This is awful.,
204,,Raphael,"Senpai, what you just said could be filed for sexual harassment.",
205,,,"Even with such strict words, she has such gentleness.",
206,,,But something else lingered on my mind.,
207,,,Did my Valentine's Day end just like that?,
208,,Raphael,This was meant for people who are extremely weak or those overly depleted of their magic. For people in a healthy condition like you to consume it…,
209,,*,What… What would happen?,
210,,Raphael,A mutation.,
211,,*,……,
212,,Raphael,"Oh, I'm kidding, Senpai. It was a joke to lighten the atmosphere, were you scared?",
213,,*,But it wasn't funny at all.,
214,,Raphael,"How do you feel? Do you feel any discomfort anywhere? Here, drink this.",
215,,*,"I think I'm fine, apart from my body feeling highly energetic. Is this tomato juice? Thanks ---",
216,,Raphael,"No, it's chili juice.",
217,,*,Blaargh ---,
218,,Raphael,Senpai… I think your taste buds might've been affected. Or it could be that… your taste buds have been highly enhanced.,
219,,*,What do you mean?,
220,,Raphael,"This might be a side effect of the tranquilizer. If I were to give you a poisonous drink right now, you could probably finish it without a problem.",
221,,*,What kind of a joke is that… Who wants such an enhancement --- All I want to do is eat chocolates.,
222,,Raphael,"If it’s an enhancing solution, then we just need to diminish its effects or neutralize it. The ingredients I would need… let me see… I should be able to find it on the back mountain.",
223,,*,Really?,
224,,Raphael,"Yes, can you come with me to gather the ingredients.",
225,,*,Of course. Please find the cure!,
226,,*,"Wow, I didn’t realize there were all sorts of plants growing on this mountain.",
227,,Raphael,Is it a lot? This mountain is like my backyard. I can name each plant growing here. There are even new species that I created.,
228,,*,Raphael… You're really hard working…,
229,,Raphael,"You’re quite the hard worker too, Senpai. Or I should say, all the students at Yume Academy are hard-working indeed.",
230,,Raphael,"When I see everyone putting in so much effort, especially you, I feel that I want to do something for all of you. Even if my capabilities are limited.",
231,,*,(Raphael is extremely reliable.),
232,,*,"This herb looks just like the one recorded in the book, would it be able to cure me? Hmmm… can it be eaten directly? Let’s try ---",(Take a bite)|Give it to Raphael
233,Poisonous Herb,Raphael,"Please wait --- It’s not a cure, it’s poisonous, Senpai! Am I too late again?",
234,,*,Why are there so many tiny stars twirling…,
235,,,Thud!,
236,,Raphael,"Deary me, it was too late after all… The herbs were quite different…",
237,,Raphael,"Honestly, you should wait till someone is done speaking before you act next time.",
238,,,The last image I recalled was a look of regret on Raphael's face as my consciousness slowly faded away.,
239,,Raphael,"Senpai, if you look closely you’ll notice that the herb shown in the book consists of three single leaves.",
240,,*,Oh! I see! Then what is this herb?,
241,,Raphael,It's a poisonous plant that merely looks alike.,
242,,*,Luckily I didn't swallow it…,
243,,Raphael,"Senpai, you really have to be more careful next time. First, it was the chocolates and now almost the herb?",
244,,*,"Ah, you're mean.",
245,,Raphael,"As a doctor, naturally, we have to be very careful. After all, I have to take care of all the students at the academy.",
246,,Raphael,"I'm not as wise as KongMing, nor as fierce as Michael.",
247,,Raphael,"But I am using all the methods that I can to protect the school and you as well, Senpai.",
248,,Raphael,"Whether I’m a doctor or a friend, this is the purpose that I exist.",
249,,Raphael,"What is Yume Academy to you, Senpai?",
250,,Raphael,"For me, it's like a second home. Seeing all of you here, makes me feel at ease.",
251,,Raphael,It's like a wandering bird that finally found a solid place to land… and that is why I have to protect this place and everyone in it.,
252,,*,"Although you can be strict at times, but you're reliable too.",
253,,*,I think it's a gentleness that only belongs to you.,
254,,Raphael,"Oh, the flattery again. But it does make me quite happy.",
255,,*,I meant it from my heart.,
256,,*,Ah… found it! This should be it!,
257,,,A soft ray of light from the setting sun lit up a three-leaved herb.,
258,,,It was camouflaged within the sea of green.,
259,,Raphael,"I’m glad you were able to find it, despite how inconspicuous it was.",
260,,*,"Well, a three-leafed herb is rare after all.",
261,,*,"(Although it may be inconspicuous, it is also unique)",
262,,*,"Just like you, Raphael. Your presence is unique too.",
263,,,"But on top of that, you shine brightly…",
264,,Raphael,……,
265,,*,Did I just catch you blushing?,
266,,Raphael,"Although we've found the ingredient and it can be consumed directly, but considering that today is Valentine's Day…",
267,,*,?,
268,,Raphael,And… voila!,
269,,*,What is it?,
270,,Raphael,You said that you wanted chocolates and I wanted to show you that I don't only make strange concoctions.,
271,,Raphael,"Considering that it was my fault today, I've made something for you. Please accept my antidote chocolates.",
272,,*,"Thank you, Raphael! You've always been thoughtful.",
273,,*,I really enjoyed spending the day with you.,
274,,Raphael,I'm glad.,
275,,*,"Even after everything that occurred, I guess I could still count this as receiving chocolates on Valentine's Day.",
276,,*,(But what was I supposed to do today again?),
277,,,And so ends this joyous and inexplicable day.,
278,,,"And I gotta say, Raphael's culinary skills",
279,,,are pretty good after all.,
280,Spring Romance,Iron Fist,"I'm really sorry to trouble you, Senpai.",
281,,*,"It's all right, I was worried since you looked troubled.",
282,,*,How does the letter look?,
283,,Iron Fist,It's rectangular and white…,
284,,*,Uh ---,
285,,*,"Are there any more distinctive features, perhaps?",
286,,Iron Fist,It has a green ribbon on it and I tied it into a bow.,
287,,*,"All right, then I'll look for that.",
288,,Iron Fist,I'm really sorry to trouble you.,
289,,*,"How are we to find it when the wreckage covers a broad area? Iron Fist, can you remember which bookshelf the book was sitting on?",
290,,*,"Nevermind. The entire library is a wreck anyways, it wouldn't make a difference.",
291,,Iron Fist,Unfortunately…,
292,,*,What if it's already been blown away by the wind?,
293,,Iron Fist,"Ah, but we have to find it!",
294,,Valeera (from afar),"Come out here right now, Skye!!!",
295,,*,……,
296,,Iron Fist,……,
297,,*,"Eek… Well, we better get a move along and find that book.",
298,,Iron Fist,Ye…yes.,
299,,*,"If those two start a fight nearby, whatever remains of the library will be destroyed.",
300,,Iron Fist,"Please don't say such scary things, Senpai!",
301,,*,I feel like there are some really thin rays of light around here. Just like this one ---,
302,,Iron Fist,Be careful!,
303,,*,This is…,
304,,Iron Fist,"It's razor sharp fishing line. It's probably a trap that was set up. If you don't be careful, it can cut your throat.",
305,,*,Woah! That was close! Why are there such dangerous things there?,
306,,Passing Student A,Apparently it's Skye's masterpiece.,
307,,Passing Student B,"If you want a catch a peculiar thief after all, you have to make the right preparations.",
308,,Passing Student A,Or maybe she just pulled a prank since there clearly wasn't a need to set it up.,
309,,Passing Student B,"Exactly, all these strange traps are just adding additional trouble to clearing up this mess.",
310,,*,Skye! You better come out here right now!,
311,,Iron Fist,……,
312,,Iron Fist,"Senpai, let's go search over there.",
313,,*,"Just be careful, Iron Fist",
314,,*,Who knows what other traps there are.,
315,,Iron Fist,"Yes, I will.",
316,,*,"Say, half the library is almost destroyed and yet the traps are still fully intact. Could this be what the legends say about vast power differences.",
317,,Iron Fist,Maybe Skye is actually a powerful genius!,
318,,*,There's something that looks like a bomb in front... Is it a library decoration?,
319,,Iron Fist,Uh... I think that's a real bomb...,
320,,*,What about the ticking sound?,
321,,Iron Fist,It's a countdown timer.,
322,,*,Why are none of you panicking?,
323,,Iron Fist,Because... because I'm sure Skye wouldn't go that far.,
324,,*,After she's already destroyed half the library?,
325,,*,What's this?,
326,,*,"A manual? ""A simple guide to removing storm bombs""?",
327,,Iron Fist,"See! I knew Skye wouldn't go that far. Senpai, let's follow the manual and disarm the bomb.",
328,The Blast,*,What the heck is a storm bomb?,"It's too dangerous, let me do it|Let's wait a moment"
329,,Iron Fist,"Senpai, I can't let you do such a dangerous thing alone. Let's do it together.",
330,,*,You can just stand by... It's my duty as a Senpai to do it.,
331,,Iron Fist,But... what if you get hurt?,
332,,*,Then we'll deal with it when it happens.,
333,,Iron Fist,"Wait, Senpai! There's still a small description at the back of the manual.",
334,,*,Cut the blue...,
335,,,Boom!,
336,,,Is this what getting blasted off feels like---,
337,,Iron Fist,Sen---pai---!,
338,,,"In this moment, I was blasted off into the sky like a rocket from Skye's storm bomb",

340,,*,"""A friendly reminder from its creator: Are you brave enough to do it?""",
341,,*,……,
342,,*,I don't know who to say this to but...,
343,,*,What's that all about?,
344,,Iron Fist,Um... Senpai!,
345,,*,What?,
346,,Iron Fist,I think the countdown has ended.,
347,,*,！！,
348,,,"In that instance, the countdown was at 00:00",
349,,*,Iron Fist! Watch out!,
350,,Iron Fist,"Ah, Senpai you're grasping me.",

357,,,After searching for a tiresome 3 hours...,
358,,*,There was no results as expected from the library search.,
359,,*,Iron Fist---,What about searching on the right?|I think it's time for us to leave the library
360,Shooting Stars,*,I don't think we've searched on the right side yet?,
361,,Iron Fist,"Yes, we haven't.",
362,,*,Then let's head over.,
363,,Passing Student A,Huh? Why is there a letter hanging on a branch here?,
364,,Iron Fist,！！？,
365,,*,"What's wrong, Iron Fist? Your face is red---",
366,,Passing Student B,"""From the moment I met your eyes..."" Ah, it's a love letter? It's even so cliche!",
367,,*,"A love letter? There's a love letter? I haven't even received one before, what is the letter like---",
368,,Iron Fist,"No, don't read it---! (Punch)",
369,,*,Ahhh! Iron Fist... why did you...,
370,,Passing Student A,"Geez, I was just passing by..",
371,,,I didn't know the sky was this blue...,
372,,,I flew so far...,
373,,Passing Student B,"Wow, he flew pretty far from one punch, guess Iron Fist is pretty strong.",
374,,Valeera,Is that two shooting stars I see above the library?,
375,,Valeera,Anyways... SKYE! WHERE --ARE--YOU,
376,,,The last thing I witnessed was probably that bright sky above Yume Academy...,
377,,*,Why don't we call it a day at the library since we haven't found anything here.,
378,,Iron Fist,Okay then.,
379,,,Central Campus,
380,,*,I didn't expect it to be so lively today...,
381,,Iron Fist,Me… me neither.,
382,,*,"Iron Fist, I've been meaning to ask, what type of letter is it?",
383,,Iron Fist,Ummm.... uh.. It's….,
384,,*,Are you okay? Your face is red.,
385,,Iron Fist,"No, it's not!",
386,,Iron Fist,It's just a letter that has a secret chocolate recipe in it!,
387,,*,Chocolate?,
388,,*,"Ah, it must be a really delicious recipe for it to be this important to you.",
389,,Iron Fist,It's... it's okay,
390,,*,"(She seems really down, I should find a way to cheer her up.)",
391,,Iron Fist,"Senpai, why are suddenly grabbing my hand...",
392,,*,"There seems to be some fun events happening there. Let's go check it out ---- Ah, why is your face so red! Are you all right?",
393,,Iron Fist,I'm... I'm fine,
394,,Iron Fist,Senpai... what is this?,
395,,*,"""30 Minutes Chocolate Making Contest"" --- Let's give it a try! Seems like it'll be lots of fun!",
396,,Iron Fist,But... but...,
397,,*,"Well, are you going to be down the whole time if you can't find your secret recipe? I can't accept that...",
398,,*,"Even if there isn't a secret ingredient in the chocolate, chocolates made with love are the best, that's what I think!",
399,,Iron Fist,"Wow, Senpai, you're really cool!",
400,,*,"Don't undermine my cooking skills! You may think that I can't cook, but even a guy like me can make instant noodles!",
401,,Iron Fist,"Even while saying silly things, Senpai is still cool!",
402,,*,What's silly!,
403,,,The contest was surrounded by crowds of people.,
404,,Iron Fist,"Eek, I'm so nervous. There are so many people watching below the stage. Luckily Senpai is here to give me courage.",
405,,Iron Fist,Senpai?? You seem more nervous than me.,
406,,*,Is... is this salt? Why does it taste like sugar?,
407,,*,"Damnit, added the wrong ingredient.",
408,,*,Ahhh! The milk spilled over! It's spilling over the edge of the table!,
409,,Iron Fist,……,
410,,Iron Fist,I... I have to focus. Senpai is always encouraging me.,
411,,Iron Fist,"This time, I have to be more reliable so that Senpai can rely on me too.",
412,,Iron Fist,"Senpai, let me take over.",
413,,Iron Fist,"Pass the mold to me, you can be in charge of stirring.","Wow, Iron Fist is really competent|I feel embarrassed"
414,,*,"Iron Fist, you really shine when you're so focused.",
415,,Iron Fist,"Senpai, if you compliment me, I'll blush.",
416,,Iron Fist,But the compliment makes me happy too.,
417,,Iron Fist,"Ah, I think it's done.",
418,,Iron Fist,"Senpai, could you please take them out of the fridge.",
419,,*,I suddenly feel quite helpless.,
420,,Iron Fist,"No way, Senpai! You've helped me so much!",
421,,Iron Fist,"When Senpai is around, I can always feel calm.",
422,,Iron Fist,Even if you might not know anything about cooking.,
423,,Iron Fist,And may be clumsy in the kitchen I still---,
424,,*,"All right, all right, I get it... Iron Fist...",
425,,*,My heart is aching already.,
426,,Iron Fist,It's done!,
427,,*,Amazing!,
428,,Iron Fist,"Ahhhh... Senpai!! Oops, sorry, am I getting too carried away?",
429,,*,"Don't worry about it. Iron Fist, you should be more confident like just now. Your confidence truly shone through.",
430,,Iron Fist,(Blushes),
431,,*,"Your chocolates are adorable, it's even peach-shaped.",
432,,Iron Fist,It's…meant to be heart-shaped.,
433,,*,"Ah, I'm sorry... But all in all, you're were really great out there.",
434,,*,"These chocolates are filled with our love, blood and sweat and is the world's most unique chocolates ever!",
435,,*,"In comparison to a chocolate recipe that is replicated, these chocolates are way more precious to me.",
436,,Iron Fist,Sen... senpai,
437,,Iron Fist,Can I give these unique chocolates to you?,
438,,Iron Fist,"Ah, I know we made this together and I'm giving it to you but...",
439,,*,I'm really happy!,
440,,*,My first chocolates received on Valentine's Day! My Valentine's has been made!,
441,,Iron Fist,Ah! It's the first chocolates Senpai received…? I'm so glad!,
442,,Iron Fist,Really... really glad.,
443,,,"Seeing her happy face, I felt extremely happy too.",
444,,,"This counts as a meaningful day too, right?",
445,,,Even if I didn't make it to the main chocolate contest.,
446,A Crown for You,*,"I didn't think a necklace would mean so much to you, Phoenix.",
447,,Phoenix,"Well, it's my very first precious treasure that I made.",
448,,*,"I'm not sure that ""treasure"" is the correct word here...",
449,,Phoenix,"Well, achievers don't worry over small matters. Senpai, let's go investigate quickly!",
450,,*,This is all quite sudden and I'm not sure what to make of it.,
451,,*,"If you're asking for help, at least let me know what's going on?",
452,,Phoenix,"It's very simple. My necklace has disappeared, if we catch the two thieves that came to disrupt the school last night then I should be able to find it.",
453,,*,Last night?,
454,,Phoenix,"There was a huge disturbance last night, Senpai, were you not aware? And I thought only a fool could've slept through it.",
455,,*,"Well, I'm sorry but not only did the fool keep on sleeping but he was even in deep sleep!",
456,,Phoenix,"Ah, I'm sorry!",
457,,Phoenix,"They are very famous thieves recently, specializing in stealing valuable items, my necklace must have been targeted.",
458,,Phoenix,They even sent out a notice saying they're going to steal something valuable from Yume Academy.,
459,,Phoenix,"At the time, nobody took it seriously... We just thought they could be easily handled.",
460,,*,That means all of us who went to bed on time should get an apology!,
461,,Phoenix,Didn't I already say sorry! Then I'll apologize again! I'm sorry!,
462,,*,....,
463,,*,"So, what kind of necklace do you have? A ruby necklace? Emerald? Black pearl? Maybe it's a diamond necklace...",
464,,Phoenix,It's roses...,
465,,*,...,
466,,Phoenix,It's a necklace made of roses.,
467,,*,Come again???,
468,,Phoenix,"Yes, it's handmade personally and the only one that exists in the whole wide world...",
469,,*,"(Without expression) Oh, sure, I get it. I don't think I'm feeling so well anymore...",
470,,Phoenix,Fist of Justice---!,
471,,*,Ka-pow!!,
472,,,10 Minutes Later,
473,,Phoenix,"Sorry, I couldn't control my strength. Once you're a bit better then let's get going, Senpai!",
474,,*,I should've just ran off to the contest instead of getting mixed in all this.,
475,,Phoenix,"Senpai, there is a saying that goes ""if you can't do anything to prevent it, you might as well sit back and enjoy it.""",
476,,*,(Speechless...),
477,,Phoenix,"Senpai, what's wrong, you look terrible.",
478,,*,……,
479,,*,"Nevermind, let's just figure out where to find it.",Maybe it wasn't stolen|It could be lost somewhere
480,Truth Hurts,*,"After all, you said they are famous thieves, maybe they're not interested in quirky things.",
481,,*,Peculiar thieves also have aesthetics. I believe they can tell between what's valuable and what's not.,
482,,Phoenix,Divine Punishment!!!,
483,,*,Ka-pow! A stronger version of the last punch...!,
484,,Phoenix,"Ah, I accidentally threw in punches again! Senpai! Senpai!",
485,,Phoenix,Senpai's not very tough is he? Passing out so quickly.,
486,,,"The moment I fainted, a thought crossed my mind",
487,,,Don't joke with sensitive people... it could cost you your life.,
488,,*,What if it was simply lost. Let's try and search for it first.,
489,,Phoenix,"Well... since you're adamant about it, I'll reluctantly believe it. Reluctantly.",
490,,*,"You don't have to force yourself, you know?",
491,,Phoenix,The field... the classroom... Mmm... the classroom was where the necklace was created.,
492,,*,Then let's head to the classroom first.,
493,,Phoenix,Then FULL SPEED AHEAD!,
494,,*,(Phoenix is really energetic),
495,,*,Well I guess that's her trait after all.,
496,,Phoenix,What?,
497,,*,"Oh, nothing. Let's continue",
498,,*,Why is that necklace so important? Are you giving it to someone?,
499,,Phoenix,"No, that necklace was personally handmade--",
500,,Phoenix,It's the first time I've made something beautiful and the result was outstanding! It's a precious memory that I want to cherish.,
501,,*,……,
502,,Phoenix,"Even an impatient person like me can make such beautiful things. It is true that if you work hard, anything is possible.",
503,,*,So you were really not joking?,
504,,Phoenix,How rude! You seem like you deserve another punch.,
505,,*,"Ah, we're at the classroom. Let's see.... Ah, guess it's not here after all.",
506,,Phoenix,Don't change the subject!,
507,,,"After that, we checked the field and the self-study room.",
508,,,With only the girl's bathroom remaining to be searched.,
509,,,Phoenix is really full of energy.,
510,,*,"And so, this lively day went by just like that.",
511,,Phoenix,And we still couldn't find it. It must've been stolen then.,
512,,*,I honestly think that even a mere thief wouldn't steal such a thing.,
513,,*,"Ah~ Even if a day was wasted, I feel strangely happy.",
514,,*,We've managed to accomplish nothing and yet it felt highly accomplishing too.,
515,,Phoenix,"What does that mean, Senpai?",
516,,*,It means that just having you beside me makes me feel naturally happy!,
517,,Phoenix,This... Is this a compliment?,
518,,*,I guess... so...,
519,,*,"Ah, Phoenix, look... Is that the necklace you were searching for?",
520,,Phoenix,Where? Where?,
521,,Phoenix,Oh my! Why is it in the trash pile！ Margaret--,
522,,*,... Margaret?,
523,,Phoenix,"Yes, it's the name I gave to my first handmade item. After all, it's something that's cherished.",
524,,*,I think whatever I say wouldn't matter.,
525,,Phoenix,"Then don't say it. Senpai, isn't Margaret great!",
526,,*,"If it's a Halloween prop, yea, it's great.",
527,,,"From the look, it looks more like a flower crown...",
528,,Phoenix,"You honestly have no imagination, Senpai",
529,,*,"Who's head can actually fit through this ""necklace"".",
530,,,Hmm?,
531,,,Phoenix gently leaned closer and held out her hand.,
532,,*,Yea...?,
533,,Phoenix,"If it's flower crown? Then so be it. Just know that Margaret is priceless! Seeing that you've helped me all day, Senpai, I'll give the crown to you.",
534,,,It may have been the setting sun or a mirage,
535,,,But Phoenix seemed to be blushing.,
536,,*,"Oh, I should say, I'm honored.",
537,,,(Although I would've preferred chocolates.),
538,,Phoenix,Here!,
539,,*,What is this?,
540,,Phoenix,"It's chocolates! I bought it along the way, but I have to say Margaret is worth much more--",
541,,*,When did you even... buy it?,
542,,Phoenix,I went to buy it when I asked you to keep watch as I searched the girl's bathroom.,
543,,Phoenix,"But since you were so focused on counting ants while waiting, I decided not to disturb you and go check out other locations.",
544,,*,If it weren't for you I wouldn't be counting ants…!,
545,,,I was on the lookout for an hour and got bored.,
546,,Phoenix,"Sorry, you looked really focused.",
547,,*,"(Wow, she's really innocent. Not being able to read the situation)",
548,,Phoenix,"Well then, Margaret and the chocolates are my Thank You gift to you, Senpai! By the way, it's a Thank You gift, not a Valentine's Day gift.",
549,,Phoenix,But when you said you were quite happy being with me.,
550,,Phoenix,I felt really happy when I heard it.,
551,,Phoenix,"Thank you for today, Senpai!",
552,,,Phoenix looked quite happy.,
553,,,"And as I wore the flower crown, I thought,",
554,,,perhaps this dusty crown,
555,,,is indeed more valuable than the chocolates.,
556,Best Partner,*,I'll punish them! Punish them!,
557,,Rogue,"Seeing you more worked up than me, then I'm relieved.",
558,,*,Of course! I am a Senpai of justice!,
559,,Rogue,Then I trust that my justice partner will catch the thieves together!,
560,,Rogue,"Well, I hope you're not bluffing.",
561,,*,"You take everything too seriously, Rogue.",
562,,Rogue,Then let's go--,
563,,,After a long and hard 10 minutes walk later...,
564,,*,(Rogue has an impeccable amount of energy.),
565,,*,(Almost too incredible),
566,,Rogue,"Senpai... please don't look so glum, we've only been investigating fot 10 minutes",
567,,*,But a 10 minute thorough investigation 3 times around campus is too much--,
568,,*,At least don't force others to do things when I don't have monstrous strength like you. I'm quite slender.,
569,,Rogue,Who's a monster!,
570,,*,"Besides, aimlessly searching serves no purpose.",
571,,,We're just heading in at full speed raid.,
572,,,"(As a highly professional detective, shouldn't you be collecting clues and making a conclusion based on them.)",
573,,Rogue,"Of course there was a purpose. On site investigation is important. I trust my instincts, there must be some clues over there--",
574,,Rogue,Please! My heavenly instincts! Bless me now and let me find my clues as you've blessed gambling!,
575,,*,This is not the situation where you pray to God…,
576,,,"(What the hell is ""blessed gambling""? What kind of life has she been living up till now.)",
577,,Rogue,"Well then, my instincts tell me that --- we should head this way next.",
578,,*,A haunted… haunted house?,
579,,,Why is there such a facility at the Valentine's Day celebration event? Does the organizer have a certain hobby?,
580,,,Is it not actually for their entertainment?,
581,,Rogue,"Senpai, what's wrong? Don't tell me, you're actually scared?",
582,,*,──,As if! Let's head in!|Why do we have to investigate in a haunted house?
583,Spooked Out,*,Who…who's scared? It's not like I've never seen a ghost.,
584,,Rogue,"Besides ghost, there might be vampires too.",
585,,*,"(So apart from Wraith, Dracula might make a guest appearance too…?)",
586,,Rogue,"Senpai, your expression really doesn't hide anything. Wraith and Dracula would definitely not be here.",
587,,Rogue,There might be ancient monsters lurking inside.,
588,,*,"Who… who're you trying to scare? I'll show you, let's head in.",
589,,*,(Opens the door vigorously) Hey! All you fake ghosts and monsters I'm not afraid of…,
590,,,Booooo----,
591,,*,Ahhhhh!,
592,,Rogue,"Ah, he flew pretty far--",
593,,Rogue,"Senpai, really? Did you not read the sign on the front door that says ""Do not enter"".",
594,,Rogue,"Getting hit by such a small monster created from subtle magic. Wow, Senpai, you're lame.",
595,,Rogue,"Ah, well. Guess I still have to head in on my own after all. Having an extra hand doesn't mean it'll be useful.",
596,,,"And just like that, Rogue left without hesitation.",
597,,,"I laid on the ground and thought,",
598,,,who would have a haunted house at a Valentine's event? It doesn't make sense.,
599,,*,Why do we have to go to a haunted house?,
600,,Rogue,"Because the most dangerous place in the world is the safest place. Stolen things should be hidden in the dark, right?",
601,,Rogue,"Senpai, let's go in together!",
602,,*,(Why do I get the feeling that Rogue only came to have fun.),
603,,*,"What is this ""Do not enter through front door""? What's that supposed to mean?",
604,,Rogue,It means what it says. The real entrance is on the side~,
605,,,This? The thing that looks like a window is an entrance?,
606,,,Speechless,
607,,Rogue,"Senpai, what are you waiting for, an open invitation? Are you coming in?",
608,,*,Please wait a minute.,
609,,,Senpai leaves for 3 minutes.,
610,,Rogue,What is all this?,
611,,*,"No, I just bought some small ornaments. I just thought… nevermind… Don't mind it!",
612,,Rogue,"Cross pendant, garlic, silver nails, salt… etc. This clearly shows you're scared.","Well, I am!|Let's think of what to do next"
613,,*,You already said I'm slender.,
614,,Rogue,"Well, you're Senpai!",
615,,Rogue,Act like a Senpai! Ya-hoo!,
616,,*,Ahh-- Don't hit me--!!,
617,,Rogue,What are you screaming for? I was just catching the garlic that was falling. Don't need to get scared!,
618,,*,Ah--- What is that in front?,
619,,*,So what's next?,
620,,Rogue,Let's enter from the side and see.,
621,,*,"Is there anyone that visits this haunted house… Ah, I'm pretty tired from all this walking.",
622,,Rogue,Senpai… you just lack exercise.,
623,,？？？,(A deep growl),
624,,*,How do they hide such a big monster in such a small house?,
625,,Rogue,"That's probably because it doesn't have a physical form and is just a virtual image created from magic. With such little magic, one punch and it'll probably shatter.",
626,,*,"Or more like, if I was to get hit by it, the one's that's shattering is me.",
627,,Rogue,"Senpai, you seriously lack training. Do you need me to train you ""Rogue-style""?",
628,,*,"No, thank you. The training style sounds dreadful already.",
629,,*,"(That means, this dark space is filled with all sorts of magic)",
630,,*,"Is that what a ""haunted house"" is like? And I thought it's something where frightening things jump out to scare you.",
631,,Rogue,"For someone that was frightened a moment ago, what are you saying?",
632,,*,"Have you always had such a toxic mouth, Rogue?",
633,,Rogue,It's called a sharp tongue!,
634,,？？,Roooarrr---,
635,,*,Ahh!,(Be brave and punch it)|(Hide behind Rogue)
636,A Disastrous Valentine,*,Hi-ya!,
637,,Rogue,Wait! That's..!,
638,,,Pow!,
639,,Rogue,"It you hit a magic virtual image, it will repulse.",
640,,,"As my body flew into the air like a deflated balloon whizzing off, I thought to myself…",
641,,,This is the worst Valentine's Day ever!!!,
642,,Rogue,"Senpai, please don't jump over so suddenly.",
643,,*,"Ah, sorry.",
644,,*,But this haunted house is quite scary… in a certain way.,
645,,*,"But you don't seemed to be scared at all, Rogue. So what's the point of this pointless haunted house?",
646,,Rogue,"Senpai, didn't you read the notice board?",
647,,*,What notice board?,
648,,Rogue,"""Win an exclusive gift by passing all monstrous levels"".",
649,,*,What the hell is this Rpg look and feel! There is no need to use the haunted house…,
650,,Rogue,"Then let's go, Senpai! The gift is ours!",
651,,*,Aren't we investigating for clues?,
652,,*,(It's really like Rogue to think and do whatever she wants. I'm a little envious sometimes.),
653,,*,(With such bravery and a swift fighting style),
654,,*,"(No no, what am I secretly admiring her here for?!)",
655,,*,It's decided! I shall pluck up my courage like Rogue! I can't lose to her!,Escape |Dash into the haunted house
656,Confined,*,You have to be brave even when running for your life too!,
657,,Rogue,This idiot!,
658,,Rogue,That's the wrong way!,
659,,*,"Damn, what's happening?",
660,,*,(Steps onto thin air),
661,,*,Ahhhhh----,
662,,Rogue,"It was written on the notice board, Senpai. ""Those who do not follow the rules shall be punished""",
663,,* (from below),Why is there such a large confinement room underneath a seemingly small house?,
664,,Rogue,"You better do some reflecting down there. You'll probably only be able to get out in half a day. Well, I'll be off to catch the thieves.",
665,,*,Rogue...?,
666,,,"Seeing Rogue leave without a moment's hesitation, I fell into deep thought…",
667,,,"No matter how you look at it, a haunted house on a Valentine's Day probably an omen.",
668,,,Clang--,
669,,*,Aren't there too many traps set up here,
670,,Rogue,"Senpai..? Ah, he passed out from the flying spatula. But where did this spatula come from?",
671,,,A short while later…,
672,,*,Where am I?,
673,,Rogue,Outside the haunted house!,
674,,*,Then…,
675,,Rogue,"Yep! I won first place! You slept for quite a while too, Senpai. I started wondering what I should do.",
676,,*,You could've woken me up!,
677,,,This weird haunted house has already wasted plenty of time.,
678,,Rogue,"Well, just as I was about to splash water on you, luckily you woke up. Guess you probably had a feeling it was coming?",
679,,*,…,
680,,*,"Say, Rogue. Why are you so hell bent on catching these thieves? You don't seem like a person that likes to trouble yourself.",
681,,Rogue,"Ah, that's because KongMing is furious about the theft and is adamant on catching them. Besides, you can get a full year's allowance for catching them.",
682,,*,So that's why..,
683,,Rogue,"And she said furiously that whoever catches the thieves and brings them to her, will receive all the chocolates exhibited at the chocolate contest.",
684,,*,"(Firmly) Well then, let's bring the thieves to justice together, Rogue!",
685,,Rogue,Good. Although you must've been motivated by some particular reason. But keep up the enthusiasm!,
686,,KongMing (from afar),Rogue--- is that you?,
687,,Rogue,"Ah, KongMing is coming over.",
688,,KongMing,"Rogue, can I ask you to deliver the next batch of chocolates to the venue?",
689,,Rogue,Hm?,
690,,KongMing,"The stolen ones are the first batch since the previous venue was not large enough, we separated the batches… but who would've thought…",
691,,KongMing,(Grrr) Who would've thought the first batch would disappear without a trace.,
692,,KongMing,So help me deliver this batch to the venue and I shall grant you a reward.,
693,,Rogue,"Really? Then, sure!",
694,,*,(Will the chocolate reward be given as well?),
695,,KongMing,"Senpai, why're you here too?",I want to help KongMing|Happened to cross by
696,,KongMing,Thank you for your help.,
697,,KongMing,"As long as it is safely delivered, rewards of equal value will be given.",
698,,*,"Don't worry, we won't fail you!",
699,,,Rewards of equal value…,
700,,,Maybe it's the limited version chocolates! I'm so excited!,
701,,*,Rogue! Wait up!,
702,,KongMing,It is said that only the culprit will return to the scene of the crime after the crime…,
703,,KongMing,"Appearing here at this time makes you seem suspicious, Senpai.",
704,,*,……,
705,,,If Rogue would just think when analyzing the situation.,
706,,,Then we wouldn't be wasting this much time.,
707,,KongMing,What are you muttering under your breath about?,
708,,*,I'm just expressing my feelings of being Rogue's assistant.,
709,,*,"Ah, please don't suspect me, even if I may be drooling over the chocolates, but I wouldn't steal them.",
710,,*,Safely delivering the chocolates is also my duty.,
711,,KongMing,"Well, indeed, the more people, the safer it may be. Thanks for the trouble then.",
712,,*,"Let's deliver the chocolates together then, Rogue.",
713,,Rogue,"Sure, although I don't think that delivering chocolates takes two people.",
714,,,The delivery process of the chocolates were unexpectedly peaceful.,
715,,*,"But you're really good, Rogue",
716,,Rogue,"Of course, I was always favored by the Gods of gambling.",
717,,*,Not that.,
718,,*,In comparison to you… I think I'm still far behind.,
719,,,She's always so energetic,
720,,Rogue,"Don't worry, Senpai. There are certain things that you can't do but there are certain things that only you can do.",
721,,Rogue,"Although you can be lame at times, but Yume Academy wouldn't be the same without you. That's what I think.",
722,,*,Are you trying to comfort me?,
723,,,Guess she still knows how to comfort others at least.,
724,,*,"Only things that I can do, like what?",
725,,Rogue,Well… you will have to figure it out yourself. I'm not good at thinking about complicated things.,
726,,*,Must be nice to be worry-free.,
727,,,"And just like that, the chocolates were safely delivered to the venue.",
728,,*,Ah… it went surprisingly well.,
729,,Rogue,"Yea, the peculiar thieves didn't appear again either.",
730,,*,But why do you get all the reward and I didn't even get a single chocolate.,
731,,Rogue,Probably due to the exhibition. Didn't KongMing give you a scroll?,Do you want it instead? |But I don't want it
732,,Rogue,This is an honorary medal awarded by KongMing! How can you not want it?,
733,,Rogue,"Even if a useless, it can be hung in the house to ward off evil spirits",
734,,*,That sounds worse.,
735,,Rogue,"If you want to give away what others have given you, that's more outrageous!",
736,,Rogue,"Senpai, when you're like that",
737,,Rogue,I don't even know whether I should give this to you,
738,,*,So where should I hang it then? I don't need a useless reward.,
739,,Rogue,"Then what reward do you want, Senpai?",
740,,Rogue,Like... this one?,
741,,Rogue,"Then… this is for you, Senpai.",
742,,*,Huh? Chocolates? But why is it in a skeleton shape?,
743,,Rogue,"It was the first prize that I won from the haunted house! You looked down, so I decided to give it to you instead.",
744,,Rogue,"Even though it wasn't made by me, I still hope that you can accept it as if I did.",
745,,*,?,
746,,Rogue,Thanks to Senpai today that I'm really happy. I've always spent this day alone and having someone to spend it with was really fun!,
747,,Rogue,Also your sleeping face was funny too.,
748,,*,Please forget about the part where I was knocked out.,
749,,Rogue,So… please accept it.,
750,,Rogue,I had a great time with Senpai. I just wanted to convey that.,
751,,*,"Wow, Rogue is quite thoughtful.",
752,,*,I thought she was more annoying at first.,
753,,,"As the day came to an end, she wore a big smile as I turned and showed her a happy ""peace"" sign.",
754,,,And indeed it was one Happy Valentine's Day delivery success!,
755,Valentine's Again,*,A new day… begins… again…,
756,,*,A new… day…,
757,,*,A… new…,
758,,*,Gahhh! Why is it still February 14th!!,
759,,*,"Oh my, I think my headache is getting worse…",
760,,*,(What is going on?),
761,,*,Speaking of which…,
762,,*,Who are you??,
763,,,"In that instant, my hand swiftly picked up my dollar store cup and threw it across…",
764,,？？？,How does someone just throw something over without a second thought…,
765,,？？？,At least ask who it is!,
766,,*,Ah… This voice…,
767,,*,Krystal??,
768,,Krystal,"Yes, it's me, Senpai.",
769,,*,You surprised me…!,
770,,*,What are you doing on my rooftop?,
771,,Krystal,That's not the point,
772,,Krystal,(Lightly hops off),
773,,Krystal,"Senpai, I have something to ask you, but I need you to answer truthfully.",
774,,*,"(For some reason, my heart started to pound from her serious gaze towards me).",
775,,*,Krystal… Aren't we a bit too close…,
776,,Krystal,Senpai --,
777,,*,Wait -- I'm not ready for your confession yet--,
778,,Krystal,Senpai… Can you please focus! I have something to ask you.,
779,,Krystal,How many February 14th have you experienced?,
780,,,What is she saying…?,
781,,*,Krystal… Don't tell me… You too?,
782,,Krystal,"Judging by your reaction, I guess I'm right.",
783,,Krystal,"Actually, I've been observing you these couple of days.",You're stuck too?|Observing?
784,,*,Have you been experiencing a repetition too?,
785,,Krystal,Yep!,
786,,,Then… why didn't she say anything from the start?,
787,,,As if she had noticed my confusion…,
788,,,Krystal replies---,
789,,Krystal,I wasn't sure whether you noticed it.,
790,,Krystal,It took me awhile to confirm too.,
791,,Krystal,After all… You are a bit strange at times…,
792,,,"Hey, that's mean.",
793,,,Wait! Observing?,
794,,Krystal,"Yep, I saw you getting blasted off into the sky and when you were knocked out by a spatula…",
795,,*,"Okay, stop----",
796,,,"What ""observation"", this is more like being surveilled!",
797,,,"Also, why did she have to witness all the embarrassing things!",
798,,Krystal,"Senpai, please listen to me carefully.",
799,,Krystal,I think we're stuck in a time loop.,
800,,,What...?,
801,,Krystal,Do you still remember the strange phenomenon that occurred?,
802,,*,The astrological event that occurred the night before Valentine's Day when the stars aligned?,
803,,,"Sorry, seems like I really fell into deep sleep.",
804,,Krystal,I think that was the beginning of it all.,
805,,Krystal,My power is the ability to grant the wishes of others…,
806,,Krystal,And the energy shift from that strange phenomenon fused into my magic…,
807,,Krystal,Not only that but it also collectedly accepted multiple wishes.,
808,,Krystal,"The only way to escape this time loop is to fulfill all the wishes. Otherwise, February 14th will repeat forever.",
809,,*,What?!,
810,,,How did this happen…,
811,,*,Speaking of... That's when my inexplicable headache started as well.,
812,,Krystal,"Senpai, I think that's partially due to my powers as well.",
813,,Krystal,But not entirely for that reason.,
814,,Krystal,"In addition to the magnetic field from the sky, my magic range seems to be disturbed by other external forces.",
815,,Krystal,"In order to solve this mystery,",
816,,Krystal,we'll just have to try and fulfill the rest of the wishes to see.,I think my headache's gotten worse.|The rest...?
817,,Krystal,How did this happen…,
818,,Krystal,"Senpai, can you still hold on?",
819,,Krystal,"If you can hold on for awhile longer, I can take you to the infirmary to see Raphael.",
820,,*,It won't help.,
821,,,I've been there already.,
822,,,Although I didn't end up getting a check up…,
823,,,I guess the only way now is to find out how to escape the time loop.,
824,,*,"Krystal, what do we need to do to find the rest of the wishes?",
825,,,How many are left exactly?,
826,,Krystal,One.,
827,,Krystal,That' s right. From what I'm aware of… there is one left.,
828,,Krystal,"A wish like ""I want a well-spent Valentine's Day"" or ""I want to send out chocolates on Valentine's Day""…",
829,,Krystal,Something of the sort.,
830,,*,！！,
831,,Krystal,All that's left now is to fulfill that last wish for the time loop to be broken.,
832,,Krystal,And we can finally escape from this endless cycle of February 14th.,
833,,,I see… So that's how it is.,
834,,Krystal,"Senpai, will you find the last wish with me?",
835,,Krystal,"It seems that because of this confined energy field, my perception and memory are a bit muddled…",
836,,,Do I even have the choice to refuse?,
837,,*,"Sure, of course.",
838,,,Looking across the school that's filled with laughter and joy.,
839,,,It suddenly felt unbelievable,
840,,,that all these people relived the past four days without realizing it.,
841,,*,Remarkable,
842,,Krystal,"Yep, there is no one else that is conscious of the four days that occurred, only you hold the memories of these four days.",
843,,*,A memory of reliving the same days…,
844,,,But each day was different.,
845,,*,"Krystal, shouldn't we enjoy the day too?",
846,,Krystal,What do you mean?,
847,,*,As the saying goes... to live in the present.,
848,,Krystal,Ah…,
849,,*,There's some balloons…,Take one and pass it to Krystal.|Quietly admires them.
850,,Krystal,Hm?,
851,,*,Thought you'd might like one.,
852,,Krystal,"Ye.. yea, I do.",
853,,*,The color of this balloon goes well on you.,
854,,Krystal,Really?,
855,,Krystal,Hm? What's this?,
856,,Krystal,"Senpai, do you like balloons too?",
857,,*,Yea,
858,,,The colorful balloons look like soft cotton candy.,
859,,*,"Krystal, are you hungry?",
860,,Krystal,Why are you asking this suddenly,
861,,*,Look over there!,
862,,Krystal,Hm? What's that?,
863,,,It's the stall that makes cotton candy.,
864,,,The colorful cotton candy are all gathered together.,
865,,*,"""Make your own cotton candy""",
866,,*,Looks fun! Do you wanna try?,
867,,*,I was getting hungry anyway.,
868,,Krystal,Sure!,
869,,*,Let's see… First select the sugar….,
870,,*,The sugar is…,
871,,Krystal,"This one, right?",
872,,Krystal,(Adds),
873,,*,"Thanks Krystal, were you blushing?",
874,,Krystal,Ah… No…,
875,,*,Then gather it in a circle like this…,
876,,*,"Ah, Krystal! Yours is ready!",
877,,Krystal,What?,
878,,Krystal,"Ah… sorry, I was lost in thought.",
879,,Krystal,"(Just now, Senpai… Looked quite handsome when he was focused).",
880,,Krystal,Uh…,
881,,*,You unexpectedly dyed your cotton candy all sorts of colors while lost in thought.,
882,,Krystal,Ah…,
883,,*,But I think it's great!,
884,,*,Just like the colors of a rainbow.,
885,,Krystal,Yea,
886,,*,White balloons and rainbow cotton candy…,
887,,Krystal,Hmm?,
888,,*,It unexpectedly all suits you.,
889,,Krystal,Re.. really?,
890,,,"Pure, yet richly sentimental.",
891,,,A little reckless and presumptuous.,
892,,,"This is surely Krystal, after all.",
893,,Krystal,"Senpai, over there…",
894,,*,Let's see…,
895,,*,A ring tossing stall?,
896,,,Is this really a Valentine's Day school festival? Seems more like a mixed carnival.,
897,,*,Are you interested in it?,
898,,Krystal,(Nods),I'll show you how it's done.|Let's go try it together.
899,,Krystal,Senpai…,
900,,Krystal,You don't have to force yourself.,
901,,*,Damn it…,
902,,,What's the difference between shooting hoops and ring tossing.,
903,,,"Then again, I'm not the type that is good at shooting hoops either.",
904,,,But this success rate--,
905,,Krystal,"Here, let me try.",
906,,Krystal,"Senpai, which one do you want?",
907,,Krystal,Really?,
908,,*,"Of course, even though we need to find clues.",
909,,*,But this day also only happens once a year.,
910,,*,We should enjoy it.,
911,,Krystal,Senpai…,
912,,Krystal,It's great that I chose to find clues with you.,
913,,*,That's… amazing!,
914,,Krystal,What?,
915,,,The pile of effortless prizes won is undoubtedly Krystal's triumph.,
916,,,Amazing….,
917,,,In a way…,
918,,,…it's also amazing,
919,,,…that I was unable to win anything.,
920,,Krystal,"Senpai, please don't be down… This…is for you.",
921,,*,This is…?,
922,,,A beautifully wrapped box.,
923,,Krystal,Please only open it when you get home.,
924,,*,Sure…,
925,,,"After that, we went to several other places.",
926,,,"Goldfish fishing, flower arrangement contest…",
927,,,Although we probably shouldn't be wasting time here.,
928,,,But… Krystal seemed to be enjoying herself.,
929,,*,The evening came quickly.,
930,,Krystal,Yea,
931,,,"I don't know why, but seeing Krystal holding all her prizes that she won made me feel happy too.",
932,,*,"Hm, what's that?",
933,,,"At that moment, the darkened sky suddenly illuminated with fireworks.",
934,,,Whoosh-- bang bang --- hiss,
935,,,The fireworks exploded into the shape of a flower.,
936,,,It's bright beautiful colors,
937,,,clustered together.,
938,,*,A firework show?,
939,,Krystal,There wasn't this show the previous night,
940,,Krystal,Maybe time has started to flow.,
941,,*,(In thought),
942,,Krystal,"I really enjoyed myself today, Senpai. Thank you!",
943,,,"Beneath the fireworks, her cheeks reflected with the colors of happiness.",
944,,*,I'm really happy too.,
945,,,Night. Clock strikes 23:00.,
946,,*,"Now then, time for bed.",
947,,*,(Switches off lights),
948,,,"February 15th, 06: 00 am",
949,,*,Haaaa----,
950,,,Unwraps box,
951,,,It's a box of chocolate…,
952,,*,The ribbon is even tied into a bow.,
953,,*,I see... the final wish was Krystal's wish.,
954,,,"Speaking of which, it was indeed a remarkable five days.",
955,,,The five days of February 14th.,
956,,,Although I couldn't experience a traditional Valentine's Day.,
957,,,But what does a guy like me need tradition for anyway?,
958,,,The only regret is that I couldn't make it to the chocolate contest…,
959,,*,"(Wait, chocolate contest?)",
960,,,Speaking of which.,
961,,,Who were the two peculiar thieves that snuck into school?,
962,,,Ordinary people… can't get in…,
963,,,What's the point of stealing chocolates…,
964,,*,Speaking of chocolates,
965,,*,Krystal...,
966,,,The chocolate seems to have been carefully wrapped.,
967,,*,I had a great Valentine's Day too.,
968,,*,"I think my mind was playing tricks... Well then, Phoenix, let's just say our farewells and be on our way. Take care!",
969,,Phoenix,Wh.. What? Please wait---,
970,,*,"Phew, I finally got away.",
971,,*,Hmm hmm hmm~,
972,,*,Uh oh… I've already wasted a lot of time… Guess I should dash straight to the destination then!!,
973,,*,"Ah, I don't mean you, Raphael! You're the highlight of my day.",
