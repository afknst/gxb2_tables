1,New Girls,School girls,There will be new students on campus very soon!,
2,,School girls,I wonder what they'll be like...I'm so CURIOUS~,
3,,Hottie,You will know that when they arrive~ But focus!,
4,,Hottie,"Get back to class! School is still in session, remember?!",
5,,School girls,"Okay, okay...",
6,,,The corridor suddenly turns into silence.,
7,,Hottie,Wait a second.,
8,,*,Are you talking to me?,
9,,Hottie,Don't act innocent with me. You're the only person skipping class now.,
10,,*,"So... What do you want, Hottie?",
11,,Hottie,Why are you so nervous? Are you afraid of me?,
12,,*,NO!!!,
13,,Hottie,"I know you also heard about the new students, but I'm really busy right now...",
14,,Hottie,I haven't even had time to prepare school supplies for them...,
15,,Hottie,It's worrying me. Can you please do me a favor?,
16,,*,With the supplies...?,
17,,Hottie,Huh? What else could I be referring to?,
18,,Hottie,What are you waiting for?,
19,,*,"Umm, I'll be right back!",
20,,Hottie,Still so shy~,
21,,,"When I had almost reached the Shopping Street, I overheard an argument.",
22,,,"From a distance, I could see a little girl in black standing in the center of a crowd.",
23,,Shop Owner,Are you leaving without paying? I'm not giving out all those for free~,
24,,Jacob,Sorry... I didn't know the rules...,
25,,Shop Owner,You can't leave without paying. What about working in my shop as payment?,
26,,Shop Owner,"You already have a wing and horns, so you don't even need to pay for cosplay costumes~",
27,,Shop Owner,"…Well, you still need to buy another wing.",
28,,*,"Horns, single-wing... Jacob?!",
29,,*,"Make way, please.",
30,,*,"I'm her brother, sir. How much did she eat? I'll pay for her.",
31,,Shop Owner,"Tch, look what the cat dragged in...",
32,,*,Hey! At least I have my own picture! And I'm supposed to be the main character!,
33,,Shop Owner,Not on this street.,
34,,Shop Owner,"Minions, get him! There's nobody protecting him now~",
35,,Jacob,"Who said that?! Brother, let me help you!",
36,,Shop Owner,Ug---ahhhhhhhh! She's stronger than I thought! If… if she worked in my store...,
37,,*,Get your mind out of the gutter!,
38,,*,"We meet again, shadowbringer---",
39,,Shop Owner,"Hey, stop right there! It's almost copyright infringement!",
40,,*,Sorry! Forget that... The girl of shadow-- Jacob~,
41,,Jacob,??? You know my name??,
42,,Jacob,You claimed to be my brother...Now I doubt your mental competency...,
43,,*,Seriously! We actually met before!,
44,,Jacob,Really??? I don't remember that.,
45,,*,In Discipline Committee! You and Kratos... And the Philosopher's Stone...,
46,,Jacob,Kratos? Sorry… Doesn't ring a bell… But the Philosopher's Stone you mentioned...,
47,,Jacob,Oh! My sister has arrived!,
48,,,"Following the direction of Jacob's finger, I saw a pure white figure.",
49,,,"White hair, white dress, white wing,  white everything… With a face similar to Jacob's...",
50,,*,I knew your twin would show up together! It's Esau.,
51,Sister？,Esau,"Jacob, I'm back!",
52,,,"In a blink of an eye, Esau reached Jacob.",
53,,Jacob,"Sister…don't hug me too tight, it's embarrassing!",
54,,*,Uhh…,
55,,Esau,"Oh, sorry, I didn't notice there's someone else here...",
56,,*,You also lost your memory?,
57,,Esau,"Ah! You're the... ""Senpai"" we met before~",
58,,*,You... What are you doing here???,
59,,Esau,Chill out~,
60,,Esau,"The only thing to do on a shopping street is shopping, right?~",
61,,*,Surely not for something else?,
62,,Esau,"Don't worry, the Dire inside Jacob was defeated after the battle.",
63,,Esau,Now she's just her normal self~,
64,,Jacob,(NODDING) That's right!,
65,,*,But… she seems have forgotten what happened...,
66,,Esau,Isn't amnesia a normal thing in a story about school?,
67,,Jacob,"Yeah, so don't worry about that too much.",
68,,Esau,Today we're preparing for our admission~,
69,,*,So YOU'RE the new students Hottie mentioned!,
70,,*,But I'm still worried because Jacob doesn't seem to know much about normal life...,
71,,Esau,"Don't worry, I can catch Jacob up to speed!",
72,,Esau,"Let's see...new stationery, school bag...",
73,,Esau,Jacob has everything she needs for school~,
74,,,"Suddenly, the twins were engulfed by the stuff Esau brought along.",
75,,*,This is too much! Jacob couldn't even use one-tenth of it...,
76,,Esau,"Listen, my sister deserves the best gear!",
77,,Jacob,"Sister, I also got something for you...",
78,,,Jacob's words were drowned out by a noise.,
79,,Angry Shop Owners,Stop! You fraud!,
80,,Angry Shop Owners,That's not money at all! Return all our merchandise!,
81,,Angry Shop Owners,Stop right there! It's the white wing girl!,
82,,*,White wing??...!!! That's Esau!,
83,,Esau,Huh? Me? I've paid everything in full!,
84,,Esau,They look really angry. Let's calm them down first~,
85,,*,Stop fighting! I'll pay for them!,
86,,*,(Gasping)... Just another nonsense battle...,
87,,Jacob,Thanks for helping us out a second time~,
88,,Esau,That's what we call generosity~,
89,,*,"Besides thanking me, you still owe me an explanation for the ""fraud"" accusation.",
90,,*,Have you been scamming people to get what Jacob needs?,
91,Take Flight,*,I mean… This looks like money from a board game.,
92,,Esau,Yes! Exactly~,
93,,Esau,But I still owe you a lot~ I might need to accept 10 internship offers at the same time to pay for all those bills...,
94,,*,I understand that but... You purchased way too much!,
95,,Esau & Jacob,We can't help ourselves!!!,
96,,*,But you're not the ones who are paying the bill!,
97,,Jacob,"Wait... Sister, I've also got something for you~",
98,,Esau,? A gift for me?,
99,,Jacob,From me to you!,
100,,,The girl held out her hands to show a beautiful ring.,
101,,,It was a very unique necklace.,
102,,,"It comprised two wings with white and black feathers, spreading like they were preparing to take flight...",
103,,Jacob,"Sister, the design surely suits us a lot.",
104,,Jacob,I hope we can fly up high someday… Just like this necklace...,
105,,Esau,"Don't worry, the time is coming!",
106,,Esau,We're about to join Yume Academy~,
107,,Esau,"With the protection of the Academy, we'll be able to fly however we want~",
108,,Saint,Please stop standing in the middle of the road...,
109,,*,Your timing is awful!,
110,,Saint,But I'm here as the Discipline Member!,
111,,Saint,"I heard from some of the students about the chaos in the Shopping Street, and apparently you're the ones to blame.",
112,,Saint,"So please come with me… You too, Senpai!",
113,,Passerby,"Weird, I thought Saint is no longer a Discipline Member?",
114,,Passerby,I heard some rumors that she joined D.E.F...,
115,,Saint,What did you just say?,
116,,Passerby,"Umm, we should be going...",
117,,*,"Well, Saint… The chaos is already settled, and they're...",
118,,Esau,"We're not going anywhere with a stranger! Jacob, we're going home!",
119,,Jacob,Okay!,
120,,Saint,"I apologize in advance, but this is my duty! Capture them!",
121,,*,Why can't we talk things over before a fight breaks out?!,
122,,*,This is... (gasp)…the third fight I had this past hour.,
123,,*,I'm just here to shop for Hottie!,
124,,Esau,Jacob! Now!,
125,,Jacob,Okay!,
126,,,I felt a fierce gust of wind.,
127,,,The sunlight spread on the street through their wings.,
128,,,"At that moment, no one could imagine they were two girls.",
129,,,"The Twin Wings, Esau and Jacob, are destined to be one until the very end.",
130,,*,You can't just leave me behind!! I cannot deal with this mess all by myself!,
131,,Esau,"Sorry, Senpai!",
132,,Jacob,We'll meet again very soon~ I will save my apologies till then~,
133,,Esau & Jacob,"Bye-bye, Senpai~",
134,Hunter…person?,Campus Announcement,"Attention, please!",
135,,Campus Announcement,"Large packs of wild Hunters have been observed on Campus, and students who try to pet them have been attacked.",
136,,Campus Announcement,"The Student Council wishes to remind students that wild Hunters may be dangerous, so please don't pet them!",
137,,Jacob,"Look, it's a Hunter~",
138,,Esau,Where is it? Where is it?,
139,,Jacob,It's fur looks so soft…,
140,,Esau,"Here, kitty, kitty…",
141,,Hunters,Grrr…meow!,
142,,Jacob,Are you alright?,
143,,Esau,"It's only a scratch, I'll be fine in no time!",
144,,Jacob,"I think someone is in that bush…look it, it's moving!",
145,,Esau,Those ears! Another Hunter must be hiding there!,
146,,Esau,I will pet it this time!,
147,,Jacob,"Okay, okay, just control yourself or it will run away.",
148,,Catgirl,Wh-what do you want?,
149,,Jacob,This doesn't look like a Hunter…a Hunter-person?,
150,,Mio,The name's Mio!,
151,,Jacob,Hunter…Mio?,
152,,Mio,No!!!,
153,,Mio,Grrr…no touching!,
154,,Esau,It's so warm…and soft…,
155,,Mio,…!,
156,,Mio,What are you doing with my tail?,
157,,Esau,"Awww, don't run!",
158,,Mio,"Grrrr…take one step closer, and Mio will scratch you!",
159,,Esau,I don't think Mio likes us…,
160,,Jacob,"Hey, look at this!",
161,,Mio,(Gulps) Fish…,
162,,Mio,"(Turns away) No, it takes way more than a measly treat to win Mio over!",
163,,Jacob,Not even for Tuna?,
164,,Mio,(Gulps) Tuna…,
165,,Rumpy,Meow! Meow! (Tuna! I want Tuna!),
166,,Mio,Quiet! Don't lose your cool!,
167,,Rumpy,(Sad) Mreow…,
168,,Esau,"I just want to make a deal with you, Mio~",
169,,Jacob,…Isn't that Dire's line?,
170,,Esau,Who cares?,
171,,Esau,"Mio, if you let us pet you, we'll bring you to a place where you can have all the tuna you want!",
172,,Mio,…Really?,
173,,Esau,"Of course! There will be all types of treats, and even catnip!",
174,,Mio,…Promise?,
175,,Esau & Jacob,Promise!,
176,Nomnomnomnom,Passerby 1,"Look, there's a group of Hunters!",
177,,Passerby 2,Their tail looks so soft…I want to pet them…,
178,,Passerby 3,Didn't you hear the announcement? They scratch anyone that comes close!,
179,,Passerby 1,So how come Esau and Jacob are surrounded by them?,
180,,Passerby 2,Who is that girl with cat ears anyway? I don't remember seeing her anywhere on campus…,
181,,Passerby 3,"I don't know, and I don't want to be late for class too! Let's go!",
182,,Jacob,"…A quick question, what is the last time you had a proper meal?",
183,,Mio,(Nomnomnomnomnom) Fish…Mio haven't ate fish…in quite a while…,
184,,Esau,She's cute even when eating!,
185,,,Crack!!!,
186,,Jacob,"Oh no, Mio broke a plate!",
187,,Esau,Let's get out of here before she notices!,
188,,Mio,Meow???,
189,,Sonya,Who did that!!,
190,,Esau,It's too late…,
191,,Mio,Meow…,
192,,Mio,Mio didn't mean to…,
193,,Mio,Fish…yummy…,
194,,Sonya,Did you like what I made?,
195,,Mio,Meow! (Yes!),
196,,Mio,Rumpy too!,
197,,Rumpy,Meow~~~~~,
198,,Sonya,"I'll let it slide this time, but don't do it again, okay?",
199,,Jacob,"Wow, I thought she was going to scold us for sure…",
200,,Esau,That's what happened back when we didn't finish the Omelette she made…,
201,,Jacob,Everyone love Hunters…,
202,,Sonya,"If I remembered correctly,",
203,,Sonya,You weren't here to feast but to fight last time!,
204,,Sonya,I seem to remember a certain pair of twins offering to wash dishes as payment…,
205,,Sonya,Why not start now!,
206,,Esau,"…Mio, do you have any money?",
207,,Mio,Meow? Money?,
208,,Jacob,Dishes it is then.,
209,,Sonya,Come over here!,
210,,Esau & Jacob,Looks like you will have to continue your tour without us…,
211,,Esau & Jacob,"See you later, Mio!",
212,New Home,Mio,Not all humans are bad...,
213,,Mio,"Are you full, Rumpy?",
214,,Rumpy,Meow~~~~~(I want more!),
215,,Mio,That male human was right…,
216,,Mio,He did not trick us…,
217,,Rumpy,Meow! Meow!,
218,,Mio,…! What is it?,
219,,Mio,It's the forest!,
220,,Psychic,Want to have a walk in the sun?,
221,,Psychic,But you will freeze in the cold weather outside…,
222,,Psychic,"If Bud Elf didn't agree to let us stay in her greenhouse, we would have had a hard time in the winter…",
223,,Psychic,I wonder what happened to Rumpy after he left...,
224,,,"The door of the Animal Welfare club opened, and in came the Hunters.",
225,,Mio,Blooming flowers and thriving plants…this will be our new home!,
226,,Mio,"Rumpy, scout the perimeter.",
227,,Mio,"Others, gather as many materials as you can!",
228,,Hunters,Meow! (Roger that!),
229,,Bud Elf,Hey! What are you doing in my garden?,
230,,Mio,Speed up!,
231,,Mio,Catch any fish you can find in that pond!,
232,,Bud Elf,My sedums! My Suzuka flowers!,
233,,Bud Elf,Look what you have done!,
234,,Mio,Meow? Is this your territory?,
235,,Bud Elf,"Territory? This is not my territory: this is my garden, and those are my friends!",
236,,Mio,So we can't stay here…,
237,,Mio,"Let's go, Rumpy…",
238,,Psychic,Rumpy! You're back! And those are…,
239,,Rumpy,Meow~Meow~,
240,,Psychic,"Ooooh, those are your friends! And who is this?",
241,,Mio,The name is…Mio!,
242,,Mio,You looked after Rumpy…thank you.,
243,,Psychic,Are you a student of the Academy? Do you have a Dorm room?,
244,,Mio,"I don't like ""Dorms""…",
245,,Mio,"Walls are bad, woods are good!",
246,,Psychic,Hunters like to roam freely…but you can't stay in this greenhouse either.,
247,,Psychic,But I know somewhere else that will suit you just fine!,
248,,Bud Elf,Wait! …Can you promise not to destroy the environment?,
249,,Mio,Mio doesn't have a home…,
250,,Mio,So Mio will cherish everything if I have one!,
251,,Bud Elf,If you promise to be friends with every plant here…,
252,,Bud Elf,You'll be free to stay.,
253,,Rumpy,Meow!!,
254,,Mio,Really?,
255,,Bud Elf,"I did borrow my garden to the Animal Welfare Club,",
256,,Bud Elf,"and you are…animals, I guess, so I don't see why you can't stay here.",
257,,Psychic,"Yay! Rumpy, Mio, welcome to your new home!",
258,,Bud Elf,Welcome to Yume Academy!,
259,,Mio,Are the ones in the pond your friends too?,
260,,Bud Elf,"They're not plants nor flowers, so no.",
261,,Mio,(Jumps in the pond),
262,,Psychic,"!! Stop, there are goldfish in there!",
263,A Warm Welcome,*,I wonder if Hottie can spare someone else for this kind of job…,
264,,*,Who is the new-comer this time?,
265,,Aquaris,"YOO-HOO! Good morning, Senpai!",
266,,*,"Gah!! Oh, Aquaris, you scared me.",
267,,*,You could have given me a heart attack! What's the matter with you?!,
268,,Aquaris,"I greeted you this way because I knew it was you, Senpai~",
269,,Aquaris,"Did I scare you that much, Senpai? What a scaredy-cat.",
270,,*,Of course not! I'm…I have a problem I need to solve.,
271,,Aquaris,What is it? Maybe I can help you~,
272,,*,Things might get worse if I tell you...,
273,,Aquaris,"Hmph, people always forget that I'm a Discipline Member! I don't cause trouble; I solve problems.",
274,,*,"Well, if you're sure, prepare yourself for what I'm about to tell you.",
275,,,"After telling Aquaris what Hottie asked me to do, her expression changed.",
276,,*,Aquaris?,
277,,Aquaris,"So... Senpai, are you going to visit the new student today?",
278,,*,"Yes, but she might be someone we've met before.",
279,,*,Hottie didn't give me any details.,
280,,Aquaris,I see…Let me come with you!!!,
281,,*,Keep it down!! I thought you grew up a little.,
282,,Aquaris,"Sorry, I was just too excited~",
283,,Aquaris,But I still want to be the first to meet the new girl!,
284,,*,Really? You're joining me without my permission…?,
285,,*,"But... In this case, I might have someone to take the first hit if something goes wrong…",
286,,Aquaris,Were you saying something?,
287,,*,"Nothing. You can go with me, but you're going the wrong way~",
288,,Aquaris,Oops!!,
289,,Aquaris,"If I'm still in the same Academy, then this should be the Administration Office. How on earth can the new student be here?",
290,,*,"I'm not sure, but this is the location Hottie gave me.",
291,,Aquaris,Senpai... Are you...?,
292,,Aquaris,…trying to lure me to the Student Union so they can punish me?,
293,,*,"Aquaris, your imagination is good at making up stories...",
294,,Aquaris,"Am I imagining things, or is this corridor extremely clean today?",
295,,*,"Wow, I can even see my reflection in the floor! Whoever cleaned this must be a professional.",
296,,Aquaris,But who can it be? I've never met anyone on campus whose hobby is cleaning...,
297,,*,There she is...,
298,,,Someone in a maid dress soon appeared before us.,
299,,,"On her face, a black ribbon covered her eyes...",
300,,*,P-President!!! Why are you here?!!!,
301,,,"All of a sudden, Aquaris became very alert and started speaking in an incredible pace, like she had been preparing for this moment for a long time.",
302,,Aquaris,I'm not skipping my patrol! I-It's all Senpai's fault!,
303,,Aquaris,He's so incompetent that he can't complete the patrol by himself!,
304,,Ithil,Oh really? I didn't realize there was a patrol that passes by my dorm.,
305,,Aquaris,"Wait a minute, this is not the voice of the president…",
306,,Aquaris,"(Raising her head) Oh no, it's Ithil!!",
307,,Ithil,"Since you're already here, let's have a warm-up test.",
308,,*,Never thought you are the new student mentioned by Hottie…,
309,,Ithil,"The ""new girl"" thing is just a cover-up...",
310,,Aquaris,"(Woozily) So, I can be considered the receptionist of Ithil then?",
311,,Aquaris,"Ouch! It hurts, but it's worth it. Just one more thing to brag about~",
312,,Ithil,You've broken into my dorm and made such a mess.,
313,,Ithil,"Aquaris, you and Senpai are going to clean it up for me. Got a problem with that?",
314,,Aquaris,"No, ma'am!",
315,,*,(Whisper) But I wasn't even part of the fight...,
316,,,"Oops, looks like Ithil heard me! Her death stare is so threatening…",
317,,Aquaris,"Did you say something, Senpai?",
318,,*,"Of course not... It's my duty to serve the Juniors, including Ithil!",
319,Master Chef Ithil,Aquaris,What's keeping Ithil? I thought she left the cleaning to us…,
320,,,Ithil was preparing afternoon tea.,
321,,Ithil,"Here, take a rest.",
322,,Aquaris,Is this for me? I'm so honored!,
323,,*,"That was a dumb question. By the way, Ithil is...",
324,,Aquaris,"Ah, I've almost forgotten that Ithil is also a master in housework~",
325,,Aquaris,Maybe I should come more regularly and...,
326,,Aquaris,"Ouch! Senpai, why did you hit me?!",
327,,*,I'm just waking an idiot from her daydream.,
328,,Ithil,"As I said, the ""new girl"" thing is just a cover-up, I had no other choice.",
329,,Ithil,"But as long as I'm dressed like this, I 'm still a maid, and it's my duty to prepare your afternoon tea.",
330,,Ithil,"So, if you want to take a visit, I'm always available, but it will cost you some time to help clean my room~",
331,,Aquaris,Please let me pledge to you my undying fealty!,
332,,Valeera,"I could hear Aquaris a mile away. Ithil, you should reconsider bullying youngsters as a hobby.",
333,,Aquaris,Valeera! You must be here to save me from this demon!,
334,,Ithil,"So much for ""undying fealty""...",
335,,Ithil,"Valeera, why are you here?",
336,,Valeera,We're now preparing a feast to welcome you~,
337,,Ithil,(waves her away) It doesn't need to be this complicated...,
338,,Valeera,"Regardless, we've almost finished preparations!",
339,,Valeera,Remember what happened when Mio and the Twins entered the Academy? This welcome is pretty simple compared to theirs~,
340,,Ithil,"Wait a second, isn't it the responsibility of a maid to prepare a feast?",
341,,,Ithil stopped speaking as comprehension dawned on her.,
342,,Ithil,"…You haven't even done anything for the feast, am I right?",
343,,Valeera,You got us pretty good...,
344,,Valeera,We're here to invite the chef!,
345,,Ithil,I won't help you.,
346,,Ithil,You never helped me clean the table after any feast. I can already imagine how messy it will be after this one.,
347,,Valeera,That's not true. We tried to help!,
348,,Valeera,"But you always refused our help, saying it's the duty of a maid!",
349,,Valeera,Just come with me~ Everyone is waiting for you~,
350,,Ithil,Stop acting like a spoiled child. It won't work.,
351,,Valeera,"Sigh... Time for Plan B... Turin, get her!",
352,,Turin,"Ithil, I apologize for what I'm about to do...",
353,,Ithil,I'll still win even if you bring more backup.,
354,,Turin,You're strong as always.,
355,,Valeera,(sobbing)... But I want to eat what you cook... Please~,
356,,Ithil,You're already an adult. Pick yourself up.,
357,,Aquaris,Valeera looks so cute when she act like this~,
358,,Aquaris,"Ouch! Senpai, why did you hit me again?!",
359,,*,I'm saving you from Ithil!,
360,,Ithil,"Well, it seems you're not leaving... Lead the way, before it gets too late.",
361,,Valeera,Great!!! You're the best chef in the world!,
362,The Interrupted Feast,Aquaris,GLOMP... DISH ISH DELICIOSH!,
363,,*,"Aquaris, you'd better wait until you swallow that food in your mouth before speaking.",
364,,Aquaris,(Gulp) This is so delicious!,
365,,Aquaris,Never knew Ithil is also a good cook!,
366,,Aquaris,Now I understand how perfect she is!,
367,,*,It is said that Ithil actually used to be a maid before she trained to become a Valkyrie.,
368,,*,But I never thought you could be bought off this easily...,
369,,Aquaris,What are you talking about?!,
370,,Aquaris,I've decided long ago to admire Ithil as my idol and learn from her!,
371,,Ithil,"Is that so? Since you've said that, you can help me clean up the mess after the feast is over.",
372,,Aquaris,What? Again? Please don't bully me anymore…,
373,,Ithil,"As a maid, you must be a master in all skills related to cleaning.",
374,,Ithil,"Since you've decided to learn from me, you'd better start studying immediately.",
375,,Valeera,"Ithil, this is enough already. We don't need this much service.",
376,,,"After Valeera spoke, Ithil paused.",
377,,Ithil,"In my opinion, you totally deserve...",
378,,,"Before Ithil could finish her sentence, we were interrupted by a noise at the gate.",
379,,Quinie,This tastes so good!!!,
380,,Quinie,I've never eaten such a delicious meal!,
381,,*,"Ugh, why is she here? She'll ruin all of this...",
382,,Aquaris,"Quinie, you're interrupting our feast. It's not nice.",
383,,Quinie,But being polite will keep me from enjoying this food when it's fresh.,
384,,Quinie,This food belongs in my stomach!!,
385,,,"As Quinie went on and on, Ithil became more and more angry.",
386,,*,"Aquaris, looks like you might have a partner to clean up the mess with tonight.",
387,,,"Before anyone could move, Quinie was caged in by three rather sharp table knives.",
388,,Quinie,That hurt! Why did you hit me?,
389,,Ithil,That's how I treat unwelcomed guests.,
390,,Quinie,It's not my fault. I can never resist the temptation of delicious food...,
391,,Valeera,Now what? We definitely can't eat here anymore...,
392,,Ithil,These are just daily dishes. I can cook you some more later.,
393,,Aquaris,"Wait,are you leaving now? (looks around) What about this mess...?",
394,,Ithil,"As a maid, it should be clear to you what should be done first.",
395,,Ithil,So I'm leaving the cleanup job to you and Senpai.,
396,,*,"This is the last time I help Hottie welcome a ""new"" student…",
397,,*,I'm getting tired of this nonsense!,
398,,Ithil,"Remember, clean this place well...",
399,,Ithil,I want it to be flawless when I return.,
400,Phototaxis,Aquaris,YO-HO! Good morning~,
401,,*,"Aquaris, it seems you're fully recovered. It's nice to know that you're well-rested~",
402,,*,What about Iron Fist? I hope she's ready too.,
403,,Iron Fist,"Please don't worry, Senpai~ Now I'm ready to go to school~",
404,,*,And because of that... We've prepared a new dorm for you~,
405,,Iron Fist,"A new dorm? For me? Thank you, Senpai~",
406,,*,Iron Fist is still polite as usual... I hope everyone is like that...,
407,,Aquaris,Why is Senpai the one who takes the credit?,
408,,Aquaris,It was KongMing and I who prepared this room!,
409,,*,Uh... I didn't mean to take the credit...,
410,,Iron Fist,But I should still thank you anyway~,
411,,Iron Fist,I just need to show Aquaris and KongMing how grateful I am again~ Thanks for your effort.,
412,,Iron Fist,Everything just looks like my old room~,
413,,Iron Fist,But... I hope the lighting could be better...,
414,,*,"The room is obviously backlit, and the sunlight is blocked by the curtains.",
415,,Aquaris,This wasn't a mistake!,
416,,Aquaris,We did that so the room won't get so hot in the summer!,
417,,Aquaris,"And by blocking the sunlight, we can minimize the influence Iron Fist will have because of it.",
418,,*,Am I missing something? Why Iron Fist has to avoid sunlight?,
419,,Aquaris,"Senpai, you really should pay more attention to the details!",
420,,Aquaris,Have you even noticed that there is something different about Iron Fist?,
421,,Iron Fist,Uh? Do you mean this optimized prosthetic arm?,
422,,Iron Fist,I don't think it will malfunction because of sunlight~,
423,,Iron Fist,Please don't be worried.,
424,,Aquaris,"No! It's not the prosthetic arm, but the...",
425,,*,"After all, it doesn't make any sense to lock yourself inside such a dark room on a sunny day!",
426,,*,Even Iron Fist agrees that. So let's just get rid of these annoying curtains!,
427,,KongMing,Stop!,
428,,,It's too late. The curtain is already drawn back.,
429,,Iron Fist,"KongMing, are you here to see me? I'm so happy...",
430,,KongMing,"...Someone go and hold her down, please...",
431,,Iron Fist,Why? What's wrong?,
432,,KongMing,"Iron Fist, don't you feel anything strange?",
433,,Iron Fist,"No, I think everything is fine~",
434,,*,But... You're...,
435,,Iron Fist,Ouch!,
436,,,"After the sunlight shines the room, Iron Fist somehow keeps approaching the wall unintentionally... and she hits the wall.",
437,,Iron Fist,...That hurts...,
438,,KongMing,Just as I predicted. The light is disturbing Iron Fist's sense of direction...,
439,,*,And that's why you keep the curtains closed?,
440,,*,"So, Aquaris mentioned the bionic antennae and wings?",
441,,Aquaris,"That's right. You're really ""Helping"" us here, Senpai!",
442,,KongMing,But I'm still trying to figure out the reason behind this.,
443,,KongMing,"Maybe it's a side-effect, or another hidden function of the new prosthetic arm that is yet to be discovered...",
444,,KongMing,...I'm afraid it's just Sivney's bad joke.,
445,,Iron Fist,Sorry to worry you... I didn't know...,
446,,KongMing,No worries. I believe there's a lot of secrets we need to discover inside this new prosthetic arm.,
447,,Iron Fist,Thank you...,
448,Antennae,Aquaris,I would really want to see how you fly with these new gears~,
449,,Aquaris,And they said your antennae can help collect information from the battlefield?,
450,,,Aquaris touches Iron Fist's antennae as she speaks.,
451,,,"But Iron Fist seems to be shocked by this, and her face is turning red.",
452,,Iron Fist,Aquaris... Please... Please let go of my antennae...,
453,,Aquaris,Why do you react like this? I thought it's just something bionic...,
454,,Iron Fist,"Right when you touched me, I received a lot more information than I thought.",
455,,Iron Fist,Even my body... Acts weird because of this...,
456,,*,"Enough, you're making this sound even more weird, Iron Fist.",
457,,,Iron Fist looks insulted.,
458,,Aquaris,Senpai!!! Don't watch any strange videos again!,
459,,*,Huh??? Iron Fist... I didn't watch any...,
460,,KongMing,"Alright, I think we should get outside.",
461,,KongMing,"Iron Fist, it's time for you to show your new abilities!",
462,,Iron Fist,"Okay, I can help you more after the upgrade! You'll soon know why!",
463,,Aquaris,Since you mentioned outside... Oh no! I didn't finish my patrol mission today!,
464,,*,Of course you skipped your work again...,
465,,Iron Fist,"Aquaris, maybe you can ask Iron Fist for help!",
466,,Aquaris,Oh? Really?,
467,,Iron Fist,Of course. I can't wait to show you what I've got~,
468,,Aquaris,Just like asking someone to help with my homework~,
469,,Aquaris,"Iron Fist, your dashes were amazing!",
470,,Iron Fist,Thanks to Sivney and Ithil...,
471,,Iron Fist,Oh! I haven't properly thanked Ithil for that~,
472,,KongMing,Now you can find Ithil easier than before. Just wait for her to come in a place that needs cleaning.,
473,,*,Maybe Aquaris can help us...,
474,,Aquaris,Huh? I-I... I still got a patrol mission to work on!,
475,,Iron Fist,I think I can help you with that~,
476,,Aquaris,Uh... I mean...,
477,,KongMing,"Since Aquaris has nothing else to do, let's go then.",
478,,Aquaris,Okay...,
479,Crash,Ithil,"Oh, Iron Fist. You look very alive~",
480,,Ithil,"Aquaris, I never expected that you would come and train with me so soon.",
481,,Iron Fist,Thank you. Now I'm ready for the new challenges!,
482,,Iron Fist,And I am here to thank you for the training.,
483,,Ithil,That wouldn't be necessary. I'd rather see if you have fully mastered what you've learned.,
484,,Iron Fist,Thank you for your time. Let me show you my progress.,
485,,Aquaris,It's a good idea to come with Iron Fist. Ithil probably ignored me.,
486,,*,It's not the time to pop the bottles yet.,
487,,*,She could realize that you're here any time~,
488,,Aquaris,Stop talking!,
489,,Aquaris,Ithil will ignore me as long as I stay low.,
490,,Aquaris,But I'm still envious of Iron Fist and her wings~,
491,,*,"Well, not everyone can fly. So I can understand that.",
492,,*,I was worried that she would feel unfit once she has these new gears... Don't know why I even bothered.,
493,,Aquaris,"But, I think she is... going to crash!!!",
494,,Iron Fist,Senpai! Aquaris! Get out of there!!!,
495,,*,Huh?!! Ouch...,
496,,,"After getting hit by Iron Fist, I could barely make a sound.",
497,,Aquaris,"Senpai, this surely proves that Murphy's law is true...",
498,,Iron Fist,"Sorry, Senpai. Are you alright?",
499,,Iron Fist,I'll get you to Raphael at once! You're not going to die!,
500,,*,Don't... Bother...,
501,,*,I--- I just need a rest...,
502,,Ithil,Leave him alone. He is just shocked by the impact.,
503,,Iron Fist,"Really? If you need any assistance, please just tell me.",
504,,Iron Fist,It's all my fault. Senpai wouldn't be hurt if I control my balance...,
505,,KongMing,Have you already forgotten what I told you?,
506,,Iron Fist,I didn't!,
507,,Iron Fist,"But... After all this, I doubt if I can really become someone who is reliable...",
508,,KongMing,It is true that it takes effort to master your new gears.,
509,,KongMing,But this isn't a valid reason for you to let go of your confidence.,
510,,KongMing,That will be a waste of effort for everyone who invested in you.,
511,,Iron Fist,That's not going to happen. I will get stronger and stronger!,
512,,Ithil,Then prove it!,
513,,Ithil,"Since you're already here, a warm-up test should be nice~",
514,,Aquaris,Nooooo!!! Why can't you just ignore me!!!,
515,Trouble Maker,Fenrir,Huh? Nobody answered my challenge?,
516,,Fenrir,"Just as I predicted, you are all cowards!",
517,,Fenrir,"I suggest you abandon the name of Yume and call yourself ""Yokel Academy""! Hmph!",
518,,*,"Fenrir, stop it! You've caused enough trouble.",
519,,Fenrir,Why should I listen to a nobody like you? Convince me with your fists first!,
520,,Aquaris,"Senpai, she just called you a nobody...",
521,,Aquaris,But she actually had a point... I've never seen you on the battlefield...,
522,,*,Aquaris! This is not the best time to make jokes. Let's stop Fenrir first.,
523,,Aquaris,I don't think she can be reasoned with.,
524,,Aquaris,She won't stop until a proper opponent arrives.,
525,,Aquaris,I believe it will be easier to find her a challenger.,
526,,Fenrir,Hey! What are you mumbling about?,
527,,Fenrir,Why don't you just say it out loud like big kids?!,
528,,Aquaris,"Senpai, she's offending you again.",
529,,*,"She also offended you! Haven't realized this, or are you just not reacting?",
530,,Aquaris,"I did hear what she said, but taking offense isn't really my style.",
531,,Aquaris,"In that case, her words…are…useless.",
532,,Aquaris,"This is getting old... this... Fenrir, she hungers for battle since she first entered the Academy.",
533,,Aquaris,"At first, the students agreed to fight her, but after that, she didn't know how to stop.",
534,,Aquaris,"Recently, five other students tried to stop her, but their efforts were in vain.",
535,,Aquaris,"When I arrived, I only saw the defeated Discipline Members...",
536,,Aquaris,"And Fenrir standing there, awaiting her next battle.",
537,,Aquaris,I suspect she would have me killed if I stayed there any longer.,
538,,Aquaris,It was a horrible experience I won't soon forget.,
539,,*,"But we can't leave her here. She's already starting to harass innocent students...As a Discipline Member, I'm pretty sure it is your duty to keep this from happening...",
540,,Aquaris,"I'm afraid I'm not fit for this battle, Senpai.",
541,,Aquaris,Oh! I still need to complete my patrol. See you later~,
542,,*,Wait! You don't have to run if you don't want to fight...,
543,,*,I wasn't counting on you to do that!,
544,,Aquaris,"Wow! Thanks for the show of faith... Alright, I know what to do...",
545,,Ithil,So you will accept Fenrir's challenge?,
546,,Aquaris,Of course not. I just decided to just to complete my patrols more quickly to avoid Senpai...,
547,,Aquaris,"Wait... President Ithil, why are you here?",
548,,Ithil,I just finished my duties at the Animal Welfare Club and overheard a commotion.,
549,,*,"Finally, someone here to save the day!",
550,,Ithil,That Fenrir is like a wild dog that just keeps barking.,
551,,Fenrir,"You, maid! I know you're one of those Valkyries.",
552,,Fenrir,"Let's just skip the formalities and get to business. Today, I will tear off your annoying eye-mask.",
553,,Ithil,Take it if you can.,
554,,*,Ithil! Are you alright?,
555,,Ithil,... I'm fine. Just need to recover from her last blow.,
556,,Fenrir,You took my strike and survived... Well done.,
557,,Fenrir,"It's a pity that you still failed, though. There's only one person in this world who can defeat me...",
558,,,"Before Fenrir could finish, someone arrived in a hurry.",
559,,Valeera,Ithil! What happened?,
560,Round 2,Valeera,How bad is it? Let me see your wounds.,
561,,Ithil,"Don't worry, I just took a direct hit. Why are you here?",
562,,Valeera,"After leaving the Animal Welfare Club, I heard fighting and hurried here to see what happened.",
563,,Valeera,Are you feeling any better now?,
564,,Ithil,"Yes, thank you...",
565,,Fenrir,"Hey, this sort of blow should mean nothing to you! Why do you act like you're on death's door?",
566,,Fenrir,I remember Valkyries being tougher.,
567,,Fenrir,"But since you've recovered with the help of your teammate, let's start Round 2!",
568,,*,Fenrir! This is enough! You should leave now and lick your wounds.,
569,,Fenrir,"Unlike you cowards, I won't turn down fun with some excuse about safety!",
570,,Valeera,I'm not a coward. I accept your challenge!,
571,,Fenrir,Wow~ I wasn't expecting a second challenger in an academy full of cowards.,
572,,,"Ithil tried to protest Valeera accepting Fenrir's challenge, but Valeera talked her down.",
573,,Valeera,"Ithil, don't worry about me. (Takes Ithil's right hand)",
574,,Valeera,"As a senior, I should set an example for the juniors.",
575,,Valeera,"You might be better than me in combat, but don't forget my Attainment in defense magic~",
576,,Valeera,"Who knows, maybe I can even win this.",
577,,Ithil,"Okay... I believe in you, Valeera.",
578,,Aquaris,Wow... I never thought Valeera would volunteer to do this.,
579,,Aquaris,She's leaving the Tri-Losers Team.,
580,,*,...You're shameless...,
581,,Ithil,Aquaris. Maids should also be experienced fighters. Go and help Valeera.,
582,,Aquaris,What??? But she will kill me...,
583,,Fenrir,Now I'm fighting two at the same time? Perfect.,
584,,Aquaris,We're starting now?!,
585,,Aquaris,Senpai! Is it too late to write my will? I hope you can prepare some snacks for my funeral.,
586,,Valeera,"Don't worry, you will live to eat those snacks.",
587,,Aquaris,(sighs) Okay!!,
588,,Aquaris,Senpai!! I'm still alive! It's a miracle!,
589,,Aquaris,"I would like to thank the Academy for this huge honor, as well as the cherry tree at the gate!",
590,,*,I think you should thank Valeera first before starting your performance... She took a hit for you...,
591,,Ithil,"Valeera, are you alright?",
592,,Valeera,Ouch... I think my bones are still intact…,
593,,Bruno,Woof!,
594,,Valeera,"Stop that, Bruno! It's tickles…",
595,Hidden Hobby,Aquaris,Rumpy and Bruno showed up! Now the Tri-Losers Team is complete!,
596,,*,Psychic and Mio? Did you overhear the fight?,
597,,Psychic,"After Ithil and Valeera left, Bruno and Rumpy became upset.",
598,,Psychic,It was like they were trying to lead us somewhere.,
599,,Mio,Meow... She's a berserker.,
600,,*,"That makes sense... Bruno and Rumpy are able to sense danger from far away, like a berserker's rage.",
601,,,But no one could anticipate Fenrir's strange behavior after seeing Bruno.,
602,,Fenrir,"Stop it, Fenrir! You cannot break character just because of this extremely cute dog!",
603,,,"In an effort to focus her mind, Fenrir slammed the ground with her great club and started to taunt the students.",
604,,Fenrir,Hey! Where's my next challenger? I hate waiting!,
605,,Mio,My turn.,
606,,Fenrir,"Very well. Unlike those cowards, you have the courage to stand up against me...",
607,,*,"Mio, wait a second.",
608,,Aquaris,She defeated Ithil and Valeera. How can you possibly expect to beat her?,
609,,Aquaris,"I don't know if it's Rumpy giving you courage, but you have to admit that he won't help you out...",
610,,Rumpy,Meow!!! (I'm not useless!),
611,,Mio,Meow... I wasn't planning to take Rumpy with me.,
612,,Rumpy,Meow?! Meow!,
613,,Psychic,"I'll support Mio instead. Senpai, please take care of Bruno and Rumpy while we fight...",
614,,Aquaris,"Judging from what I've seen, only Senpai, Bruno, and Rumpy haven't fought Fenrir...",
615,,Aquaris,Which means we've got us a second generation of Tri-Losers~,
616,,*,That's not a title I want to have!,
617,,*,"If you want to stop her, don't encourage her to fight more!",
618,,Mio,Meow... Are you ready?,
619,,Psychic,Yes! It's a good chance for me to test my power~,
620,,Fenrir,Are you ready?! Let's get serious!!,
621,,,Mio and Psychic became more and more exhausted as the round seemed to be coming to an end.,
622,,,"Before they could make their next move, Fenrir readied her next attack.",
623,,Rumpy,Meow!,
624,,Bruno,Woof!,
625,,*,Rumpy! Bruno! Come back!,
626,,,"Bruno jumped onto the stage, possibly in defense of his master.",
627,,Aquaris,Oh no! Bruno is going to get killed!,
628,,Aquaris,I can't watch!,
629,,,"But luckily, that didn't happen.",
630,,,"Fenrir froze in her tracks as soon as she saw Bruno. She dropped her club and held Bruno in her arms, even burying her face into his fur.",
631,,Fenrir,It's warmer than I thought.,
632,,Aquaris,What has happened? She's a dog lover?,
633,,Bruno,(whimper),
634,,Psychic,"Fenrir, please let go of him! He cannot breathe anymore...",
635,,Fenrir,"Sorry, I should've noticed that. Can I hold him a little longer... maybe 10 seconds?",
636,,Psychic,"Please don't. Bruno doesn't like you, and you will make it even worse if you don't stop...",
637,,Fenrir,Okay...,
638,,Fenrir,My heart is already taken with this lovely creature...,
639,,Valeera,Haha... Looks like Fenrir had a hard time pretending she doesn't like dogs~,
640,,Valeera,I suggest you stop being so aggressive. It might be easier to earn Bruno's friendship.,
641,,Fenrir,Tch... I won't stop doing what I should do just because you say so.,
642,,Fenrir,But... I think I can make an exception for Bruno...,
643,,Fenrir,"Bruno, let me pet you some more!!!",
644,Self Intro (embarrassing ver.),Gambler,"Tell me, what's the most important factor in winning a gamble?",
645,,Gambler,Better skills? Cheating? Wrong…,
646,,Gambler,The key factor is... Confidence!,
647,,Gambler,You need to believe that you're the dominator of this game!,
648,,Gambler,You need to believe that no one can defeat you!,
649,,Saint,"Wonderful, you certainly demonstrated the old saying: ""In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king"".",
650,,Saint,I believe you're getting your reputation back during my absence...,
651,,Aquaris,"That sounds very weird, is that some kind of accent I haven't heard before?",
652,,*,I think you should at least observe before making any conclusions.,
653,,*,Look at that empress-style costume... Maybe this is what she got from the journey.,
654,,Aquaris,"But making herself an empress? That's ridiculous, and I don't believe that will help her win any followers on campus.",
655,,Aquaris,"Besides, why isn't she even feel embarrassed after speaking so weirdly?",
656,,*,"Shhh, I hope you remember that you cannot defeat her, so if she hears what you're saying...",
657,,Gambler,Saint!!! How are you back so soon? I thought it would take you longer to complete your mission.,
658,,Gambler,(Glances at Saint) Something looks different about you…,
659,,Saint,"Tch, that was just an excuse for me to get out of the campus and search for the truth...",
660,,Saint,And now... I see everything.,
661,,Aquaris,Oh! I got it! Saint must have become paranoid during her trip!,
662,,Aquaris,"Haha, never thought she would end up like this...",
663,,*,You never learn...,
664,,Gambler,Shut it! You know nothing about Saint!,
665,,,But Saint stopped Gambler before she actually attacked Aquaris. She's going to take the honor herself.,
666,,Saint,"Gambler, let me show you what I got during the trip.",
667,,*,Aquaris? Aquaris?! Are you still alive? Answer me!,
668,,Aquaris,Not... Dead... Yet...,
669,,Aquaris,But... I don't have the strength to get up right now... My muscles are weak as a pudding made by Sonya.,
670,,*,I take that as you're fine.,
671,,*,"But Saint, what have you done to her exactly?",
672,,Gambler,"Senpai, mind your position, the person standing in front of you is: The Queen Across the Sea, The Silver Queen, The Dragon Queen, The Princess That Was Promised, The Dragon's Daughter--- Saint",
673,,*,"You know that's the description for another character who's not even in this game, right?",
674,,Gambler,Wait what?,
675,,*,"Uh... Forget what I said, that's just something that popped into my head for no reason.",
676,,Saint,"I just disabled her ability, but it's a temporary effect, she will recover soon.",
677,,Saint,"But remember, this is a cruel world, it always wants to weed out the weak.",
678,,Saint,"So I won't go easy on anyone who goes against me next time. Let's go, Gambler.",
679,Paranoid?,*,"Aquaris, how do you feel now?",
680,,Aquaris,I have recovered from pudding to black pudding!,
681,,Aquaris,The names are similar but they're actually two different foods~,
682,,,Now she gets hungry again…,
683,,*,"Aquaris, you should really go to Ithil to improve your timing.",
684,,*,"This is when we should start to worry about Saint, not your stomach.",
685,,Aquaris,"Senpai, since when did you become so responsible?",
686,,Aquaris,But since you mentioned her... Let's follow them secretly!,
687,,*,What?,
688,,Aquaris,You heard me~ I believe we will find out what happened to her if we get more information.,
689,,*,"Well... I know it's efficient, but it's the kind of behavior only perverts would do.",
690,,Aquaris,"Don't let others judge you! Besides, you're already a pervert in many students' opinions~",
691,,*,!!!,
692,,*,"By the way, are we in the wrong direction? They just took another way…",
693,,Aquaris,It takes effort to tail a person... So I say let's go to Sonya's cafeteria to eat some rice cakes first.,
694,,*,"Even if you say so, we don't look like we're tracking someone as we're walking in a large crowd.",
695,,Aquaris,"That's not my fault, how can I foresee I would become this popular someday.",
696,,Aquaris,"See, even Valeera and Ithil are here to help us out just because of how cute I am~",
697,,*,"I still think it's because of the rice cakes... And thanks to you, we're losing track of Saint now.",
698,,Valeera,"I know it might embarrass you, but Saint is right there. She's the only one here who would wear such a ridiculous crown.",
699,,Gambler,"Now let's hear it from your future king, Saint the Great! You will not only share the honor of hearing from her, but also get an exclusive keychain for your obedience!",
700,,Saint,"I hereby declare myself the rightful ruler of this land, and all you beneath me shall follow my banner and forge...",
701,,Valeera,Totally self-centered... Now I definitely believe she's become paranoid.,
702,,Valeera,I hope Ithil has a backup plan for this...,
703,,Saint,I have seen through the illusion and found out the truth. All the authorities you've experienced are but a lie.,
704,,Saint,"And you should be thankful, as your only salvation has now returned.",
705,,Ithil,"Paranoid? No, I think she's more like a fanatic cultist now.",
706,,Valeera,"Even if she is behaving strangely, that's still a mean description...",
707,,Valeera,But I think it might because of the sword she's holding right now.,
708,,Aquaris,According to a book (that Ithil forced me to read) some ancient weapons will grow a consciousness and has a possibility to control its owner. Maybe the sword Saint's holding is a weapon like that.,
709,,Iron Fist,"Aquaris, maybe you should stop talking. That kind of theory would cause a panic!",
710,,Iron Fist,But I think taking the sword from Saint is worth a try.,
711,,Saint,"Don't go too far, you are not qualified for this...",
712,,Saint,"But despite your many insults and your horrid blasphemies, I'm ready forgive all, and more, to reward your services.",
713,,Aquaris,She sounds more like a cultist than ever before...,
714,,Gambler,Aquaris! Mind your words!,
715,,Saint,Don't get angry because some arrogant nobody who cannot do anything.,
716,,Saint,"Everything you ever wanted will be offered if you but lay down your arms, and kneel to your divine empress.",
717,,Iron Fist,I... I... Don't....,
718,,Valeera,"Iron Fist, what happened?",
719,,Ithil,Saint! What have you done to her!,
720,The Greater Good,*,Aquaris became weak in the last fight just like this... Maybe Saint did this with the help of the sword.,
721,,Saint,Nice try... Maybe we underestimated you in the past.,
722,,Saint,"Our conquest is inevitable, our ascension a matter of time. Let none who are wise deny our destiny.",
723,,Aquaris,Can you at least speak normally? I'm starting to doubt if we're even speaking the same language.,
724,,Aquaris,Most of us don't understand you at all!,
725,,Saint,Silence...,
726,,Saint,"Iron Fist has some power, but to win a battle it takes more than just power.",
727,,Saint,"Just like what happened before, she will submit once I take away her power.",
728,,Aquaris,"I can vouch for that, I also became faint last time after she took my power away.",
729,,Aquaris,"She just directly takes power away, even barbarians are more civil than that.",
730,,Saint,The ones of great ambition won't bother with such small trifles.,
731,,Saint,So I don't feel guilty at all.,
732,,Gambler,"Saint, you've become so cool! Although I still don't understand what you're saying.",
733,,Ithil,"This is too much, surrender your sword and give back Iron Fist's power!",
734,,Saint,"The sword is right here, take it if you can.",
735,,Valeera,Ithil! How bad is the wound?,
736,,Ithil,Uh... I don't think it's serious.,
737,,Ithil,I never thought she could be stronger than both of us combined.,
738,,Saint,"You are strong, but this is my turf now.",
739,,Aquaris,That was the only sentence I could understand in this whole story. It means no one can defeat her in her backstory.,
740,,*,Outstanding! You acted just like you're the only one who could understand that.,
741,,Saint,"Very soon, you will come to understand that I'm your only salvation.",
742,,Valeera,That's not an acceptable attitude when you're trying to recruit.,
743,,Saint,You will soon get used to it.,
744,,Saint,"But right now, it's time for me to leave.",
745,,Saint,"And don't worry about your power, it will be returned soon.",
746,,Saint,So long.,
747,,Aquaris,Now she looks even more like a cultist leaving to start the next secret assembly.,
748,1,,"Not long ago, Kratos and Fenrir invaded Yume Academy, and no one stood a chance when faced against the first Valkyrie.",
749,,,"When all seems bleak, Michael and Lucifer combined their powers, and Nephilim emerged from the crevice between Light and Darkness.",
750,,,"With the powers of Light and Darkness, Nephilim fought against Kratos and won...but Kratos was not defeated.",
751,,,And now...their paths cross again.,
752,,Kratos,So this is the Secret Challenge they've been talking about?,
753,,Fenrir,"Yes, at least that's what I heard from the weaklins on campus. If we can pass the challenge, we can get to know their secret.",
754,,Fenrir,"Although these information would be useless to me, I think that might mean something to you...",
755,,Kratos,"That's useless, there's no secret in this Academy I don't know... (mumbling)",
756,,Fenrir,Did you say something?,
757,,Kratos,Nothing... Do you know anything more about it?,
758,,Fenrir,Uh... Ahaha...,
759,,Kratos,"If the intel is unclear like this, you don't need to come to me next time...",
760,,Fenrir,Fine... But I will let Turin tell me everything about this place later.,
761,,Kratos,"Wait a minute, you said Turin told you about this?",
762,,Fenrir,"Yup, name is Turin or something, pretty weird right? She even fights differently from the other weaklins and...",
763,,Kratos,"Alright, let's go and see what this Secret Challenge is made of.",
764,,Fenrir,"Just as I predicted, these obstacles won't be able to stop you.",
765,,Kratos,That's all? I remembered Yume defenses being tougher...,
766,,Fenrir,"But even if they didn't regress, I don't think that will be a problem.",
767,,Kratos,"Come on, we will find out the secret once after passing the next stage.",
768,2,Lucifer,"Haha, never thought you'd also skip class, angel girl. I guess you won't stand any point to judge me on that in the future~",
769,,Michael,"Lucifer, I've told you a million times not to call me that again. And if you don't come to somewhere dangerous like here, I won't skip class for you...",
770,,Lucifer,"So you're here for safety sake? Stop kidding me, I've fully recovered.",
771,,Michael,Really? Then stop using the power of Nephilim to fight.,
772,,Lucifer,Tch... Sounds like I would need that to pass this mere challenge.,
773,,,"Although Lucifer claims to pass the challenge alone, she got defeated in the first stage.",
774,,Monster A,"Hahaha, now even trash can become challengers.",
775,,Monster B,I just hope they could taste better than our last victim,
776,,Michael,Lucifer！,
777,,Lucifer,"... If you're here to laugh at me, just do the best you can.",
778,,Michael,The Lucifer I know won't give up on things so soon.,
779,,Michael,"Don't worry and use the power of Nephilim, no one else know our secret.",
780,,Lucifer,"Okay... Let's do it now. But in case you haven't noticed, you forced me to do this, understand?",
781,,Monster A,When do we have the technology to fuse trash pieces?,
782,,Nephilim,We exist as half angel and half demon. Within the trembling balance between light and dark is the relation of us.,
783,,Nephilim,"Weak! With our powers combined, there's nothing can stop us!",
784,,Lucifer,That's my move! I think that demonstrates Lucifer being the best fighter in the world.,
785,,Michael,You mean the Lucifer who just got herself beaten in the first stage?,
786,,Lucifer,Shut up! Let's just keep moving!,
787,3,Fenrir,"This is it, we'll find out their secret after passing the last stage!",
788,,Fenrir,Miscreated! Keep your eyes open and see how you die!,
789,,Kratos,"Silent, there's someone else coming.",
790,,Nephilim,Kratos? Why are you here?,
791,,Kratos,I can ask the same question to you. Are you here for the...?,
792,,Michael,For... What?,
793,,Lucifer,"We're not here for something, I'm just feel interested about the challenge and the angel girl is here to...",
794,,Michael,Lucifer! You're talking too much... Kratos is still the most wanted on campus!,
795,,Kratos,Don't be nervous~ I can tell you what I'm here for~,
796,,Kratos,"Some said here buries the deepest secret of Yume Academy. If we can work together, maybe we can share what we got.",
797,,Michael,But... I think you can do that without us. Why would you let us join you?,
798,,Kratos,Actually I'm more interested to your power. I never thought the opposing powers could be combined together.,
799,,Lucifer,"Since you've asked sincerely, I'll show you our power~ But don't mind if we happened to take the prize.",
800,,Michael,Lucifer! You should be more cautious about Kratos!,
801,,Kratos,That doesn't matter!,
802,,Kratos,"So that's how it feels when light and dark comes together, that's really interesting! Fenrir, let's go.",
803,,Fenrir,But what about the secret?,
804,,Kratos,"We've had enough valuable information today, besides, according to my knowledge of Turin, the secret might be a...",
805,,Fenrir,A what?,
806,,Kratos,"Nothing, let's just go. We've got other things to do.",
807,,Lucifer,"Angel girl, let's see what is the secret!",
808,,Michael,Stop calling me that!,
809,,Lucifer,If you are not in control I would... Tch...,
810,,Lucifer,"Fine, Michael. Michael de archangel? Let's just check out what's inside the chest.",
811,,Nephilim,Okay...,
812,,Michael,Uh... This must be Turin's prank.,
813,,Lucifer,All that just for a childish painting of Turin? That's really a waste of time.,
814,,,Kratos and Fenrir hasn't left far enough to not hearing that.,
815,,Fenrir,We almost got fooled by Turin…,
816,,Kratos,Turin's... Painting... That's just...,
817,,Fenrir,Kratos? Are you tripping?,
818,,Kratos,"No... Fenrir, you go first, I've got something I need to do...",
819,,Fenrir,What is it? Do you need my help?,
820,,Kratos,(whispers) I'm going to take the painting. It's best you don't know..,
821,Krystal 1,Krystal,"(Blushing)… But senpai, this kind of situation…it's embarassing...",
822,,*,"Don't you trust me? I'm experienced, you know.",
823,,Krystal,Okay…please be gentle.,
824,,*,I'll take it slow.,
825,,*,(Slowly picks up Krystal's suitcase),
826,,*,But it seems quite heavy… I wonder what's in it?,
827,,*,(Somewhat regretting that I insisted to help…),
828,,*,"(It's so heavy, my arms could fall off)",
829,,Krystal,Is it heavy?,
830,,*,"(panting) No…not at all, I'm totally fine…",
831,,Fenrir,(approaching from behind) I heard there's a newcomer at the academy of weaklings!,
832,,Fenrir,Just in time for me to test out my new move! Haha!,
833,,Fenrir,Hey! You there!,
834,,Fenrir,Yes! You in the shiny sparkles! You're the newcomer right?,
835,,*,"(Panting) Kry..Krystal, watch out…",
836,,Krystal,"Nice to meet you, I'm Krystal. Can I help you with something?",
837,,Fenrir,"(Hmph, replying in such a manner after getting provoked. She was rumoured to be tough, but she's just a weakling.)",
838,,Fenrir,(muttering under breath) mm hmm…I'll show her the face of reality and teach her a lesson! Hahaha!,
839,,Fenrir,Cut the crap and feel my wrath!,
840,,Fenrir,"Hmph! Seems like the effect isn't strong enough, I won't be able to use it against Kratos.",
841,,Fenrir,"Ahahaha! Seems like I still have a long way to go, too bad ... (escapes)",
842,,Krystal,"Well, she's cute…just a little…strange.",
843,,*,Cute…? Quite the contrary…,
844,Krystal 2,Iron Fist,Rumour has it that a new student is moving into the dorm. I wanna helpout~,
845,,*,"(Breathes heavily) Krystal, this is Iron Fist.",
846,,Krystal,"I'm Krystal, a pleasure to meet you, Iron Fist!",
847,,Iron Fist,"Wow, having a new junior in the dorm, it's so fascinating.",
848,,Iron Fist,"(grabbing Krystal's hand) Krystal, let me show you your dorm!",
849,,Krystal,Great!,
850,,Krystal,"(What a strange feeling, even though it's the first time we’ve met, it feels as if we'll become great friends…)",
851,,Iron Fist,"(Krystal's so friendly! Hehe, is this what it feels like to be a senior…)",
852,,*,"(Out of breath) Whew, Iron Fist is really becoming a reliable senior!",
853,,*,(But I feel as if I'm going to be out of breath if I keep lugging this suitcase…),
854,,Aquaris,(skipping in front) The sun is strangely round today and Aquaris is strangely free today~…,
855,,Aquaris,Ah!,
856,,*,Ah..!? Look out!,
857,,Krystal,"Senpai, are you alright?",
858,,Krystal,"Healing magic, restore!",
859,,Aquaris,"Sorry! Sorry! So sorry! …Oh, wait a sec, it's just Senpai. Guess it's fine then.",
860,,*,"(Ow ow ow… oh, it no longer hurts? It feels as if I have infinite strength.)",
861,,*,Thanks Krystal!,
862,,*,But sorry...I wasn't able to protect your suitcase…,
863,,Krystal,"No worries, Senpai! My suitcase is nothing compared to your safety!",
864,,*,"To have such a kindhearted junior, I'm so touched! Unlike a certain clumsy person that has no respect for Senpai.",
865,,Krystal,"(Facing Aquaris) Hi! I'm Krystal! I just moved in today, if there's anything lacking, I'll try my best to improve!",
866,,Aquaris,(What a well mannered child! I feel as if my conscience has been condemned…),
867,,Aquaris,"Hi, I'm Aquaris! But that reminds me, why is there a certain bold, daring Senpai in the female dorms again…",
868,,*,"Culprit of the event, don't try and avoid the topic.",
869,,Iron Fist,"(Laughs heartily) In the blink of an eye, time has passed already since Aquaris and I admitted as freshmans.",
870,,*,I hope that we can all live happily together from now on.,
871,,Aquaris,"Krystal, I suggest you stay away from Senpai, he likes to make us cute juniors do weird things.",
872,,*,Please don't call the duty of defending the academy weird okay?!,
873,Krystal 3,,"Once settled in the dormitory, we arrived at the clothing store with the suggestion from Iron Fist.",
874,,*,"(Hehe, only Iron Fist gets me. I love accompanying the juniors to shop and try on new clothing.)",
875,,*,"But it's only Krystal's first day of admittance, why did Iron Fist suddenly suggest that we come shopping?",
876,,Aquaris,"Senpai, why are you hiding it? Weren't you the one that hinted to Iron Fist so that you can accompany the new junior to try on clothes?",
877,,Iron Fist,"Ah, it's not like that…I don't have any special reason to…it could be that today's weather is really great! Great for shopping!",
878,,Aquaris,…Suspicious…,
879,,Iron Fist,"(When Krystal's suitcase fell earlier, I caught a glimpse of her clothes and they were quite ragged.)",
880,,Iron Fist,(Why did Krystal bring these with her? Does she not have anything new to wear!?),
881,,Iron Fist,(I brought her out shopping because I was too embarassed to ask...),
882,,Krystal,(Blushing) How does it look…,
883,,*,It looks great! The quality of the skirt suits you well!,
884,,Iron Fist,"Wow, she looks amazing. She's shining like a crystal.",
885,,Aquaris,But it definitely won't beat the outfit I picked! Let's try this one on!,
886,,Krystal,Err.. Okay.. (Returns to fitting room),
887,,Quinie,(Strolling inside the store) Mmm? There's a strange thing sticking out of the curtains of the fitting room that looks like crystalized candy!,
888,,Quinie,It looks yummy and sweet. I wanna taste it… catch!,
889,,Krystal,Ah….my tail!,
890,,Quinie,"Wah, so scary… a scary candy…",
891,,*,"Quinie, it's not a candy, it's Krystal's crystal.",
892,,Quinie,Sorry… but it looks so sweet and yummy…,
893,,Krystal,"mm hmm, it indeed should be sweet…",
894,,*,(Why does it sound like Krystal's had a taste!!),
895,,*,"(As strange thoughts occurred, weird images started appearing…)",
896,,Aquaris,(Muttering quietly) I wonder what Krystal's crystal actually is…,
897,,*,"Well then, we'll treat these new clothes as Krystal's welcome gift.",
898,,*,We hope that you enjoy your time at the academy!,
899,,Krystal,(Smiling gleefully) Mm! Thank you!,
900,,Krystal,I hope that we can live happily together forever!,
901,Trinity,Aquaris,Phew! I've finally escaped!,
902,,Aquaris,"Mean Senpai! Just because I exposed him while bragging, now he's making me train for extra long hours!",
903,,Aquaris,"Luckily Iron Fist secretly helped me out, otherwise I'd get caught by Senpai again…",
904,,Aquaris,Eek! There's a suspicious person lying here!,
905,,Trinity,(Peering) …,
906,,Aquaris,"What now? According to the past stories, I never defeat any stranger…",
907,,Trinity,I'm no suspicious!,
908,,Trinity,Ahem. Please allow me to introduce myself.,
909,,Trinity,"The name is Trinity, a loyal follower of Master Sivney and at most, a genuine ordinary girl!",
910,,Aquaris,"Ohh, so you're the new girl Senpai spoke about!",
911,,Aquaris,"(Awesome, a newcomer for me to brag about my story!)",
912,,Aquaris,"Hi, I'm Aquaris! It's good to see you!",
913,,Trinity,Sooo sleepy…. Hi…,
914,,Aquaris,………………,
915,,Aquaris,………………,
916,,Aquaris,(Why is she not greeting me properly!!),
917,Trinity,Aquaris,"Trinity, this way!",
918,,Trinity,Uh… Coming…,
919,,Aquaris,See over there? That's our dormitory.,
920,,Aquaris,And then ahead of us is our classrooms.,
921,,Aquaris,"Look, there's a garden on that side, but be cautious to never step on the plants!",
922,,Trinity,(…Could it be that Master Sivney has set some kind of trap here?),
923,,Aquaris,Over here is our playground.,
924,,Aquaris,And the building in front of you is House Monster!,
925,,Trinity,Wow! I never thought it possible to construct a building with a mechanical structure of this scale!,
926,,Trinity,And… almost all of the buildings are constructed this way… That's amazing!,
927,,Aquaris,"Oh, it's no big deal~",
928,,Trinity,You're not getting it…!,
929,,Trinity,You don't have the slightest idea!... To maintain a mechanical structure of this scale with ordinary metal materials is almost an impossible work!,
930,,Aquaris,Uh… Trinity? Please don't get too excited…,
931,,Nobunaga,"Very magnificent, right?",
932,,Nobunaga,"Dressed in such strange attire upon arrival. What a strange girl, you are.",
933,,Trinity,What's… What's wrong with this attire? It's just ordinary outfit!,
934,,Nobunaga,"Hah, I was just kidding… and where do you come from?",
935,Trinity,Nobunaga,"Ah, so that's the whole story…",
936,,Trinity,"But, I'll persist till the very end... one day, I shall achieve my goal!",
937,,Nobunaga,That's the spirit! I believe you will get what you want!,
938,,Nobunaga,"And if ever, you need help, I will always be available.",
939,,Trinity,Thank you! I'm so glad to have an ally like you!,
940,,Nobunaga,"Haha, no problem! You can count on me if you run into any trouble!",
941,,Aquaris,Seems like... I'm still incompetent as a senior…,
942,,Nobunaga,Just keep improving yourself and I believe you will achieve greater goals than I do some day!,
943,,Aquaris,"Thanks for the motivation, I'm really inspired!",
944,,Nobunaga,"Then… have you decided which House to join yet, Trinity?",
945,,Trinity,I...,
946,,Nobunaga,"If you haven't decided yet, then you're more than welcome to join us in House Monster!",
947,,Nobunaga,"Just a hunch, but I think it's fate that's brought you here.",
948,,,……,
949,,*,Pretty sure we arranged to meet here……,
950,,*,Trinity! Where are you!!?,
951,1,？？？,"Sorry, guess I win again! Hahaha!",
952,,Regretful Student,But... how...,
953,,？？？,These chips are all mine then!,
954,,Regretful Student,Sniff... Now I can only eat rice with soya sauce to pass the month.,
955,,,"A variety of stores are lined up in the shopping streets of Yume Academy, some run by individual students, while others are run by clubs and student unions.",
956,,,"Among all these stores, a store filled with all sorts of arcade machines and various sizes of table games exude a very suspicious aura.",
957,,,"At that moment, an unfamiliar face is spotted sitting at one of the tables.",
958,,Onlooker Student A,See that girl? She's got Lady Luck on her side.,
959,,Onlooker Student B,She's been winning consecutively for awhile... I wonder who she is?,"I don't think that's a good idea, Rogue..."
960,,,"The person with the big bright smile that we see is Rogue, a new student at the academy.",
961,,,She is an active mercenary in various locations with a minor reputation but also mostly... a bad reputation.,
962,,,As for the reasons...,
963,,Rogue,"Hmm? I've won fair and square, is there a problem?",……
964,,,I woulnd't expect that coming from the last person who should ever use that phrase.,
965,,,"During the game, her hand would occasionally reach down to the sheath at her waist, as if it was a natural habit, when in fact she hides her cards in a special hidden compartment in her sheath.",
966,,,The fact that none of these innocent students notice such an obvious cheat is quite tragic.,
967,,Rogue,"By the way, thanks for telling me about this great place! What a big win, hahaha!",
968,,,"Rogue, upon entering the academy has already stepped into the abyss and reached the point of no return.",
969,,Gambler,Hmph!,
970,,Rogue,Who's next? Huh? Why are you all just standing still?,

973,,Rogue,(Let's just call it a day then. A little goes a long way... there'll be plenty of opportunities later.),

975,,Rogue,(Oh? We've still got a challenger.),
976,,Gambler,"I'm Gambler, the store operator... Seems like you've been enjoying yourself and you are...?",
977,,Rogue,"Call me Rogue. Looks like you're somebody important, what can I do for you?",
978,,Gambler,"Since the opening of the store, it's the first time I've come across such a strong player as yourself.",
979,,Gambler,It's even gotten me excited to take on a challenge. How bout it? Care to share the limelight?,
980,,Rogue,Sure thing. Just the perfect way to wrap up today's gamble.,
981,,Rogue,"(They're so naive, they haven't noticed my trick...)",
982,,Rogue,"(Hehe, take this as a lesson!)",The situation is getting complicated...

989,,Rogue,...Raise.,
990,,Gambler,"Call. You seem to always touch that sheath of yours, Rogue.",
991,,Rogue,...Just a habit. Got a problem?,
992,,Gambler,Nope.,
993,,Rogue,(Why not just expose me? Or are you trying to use my trick against me?),
994,,Gambler,"Alright, showdown.",
995,,Rogue,Two pairs.\n(And there's no explanation for her bizarre luck... Maybe she's cheated too?),

1009,,Gambler,Oh...precisely. That is the condition for the final round.,
1010,,Gambler,"In order to prevent you from cheating again, we will no longer use cards, you can decide which method we will use to bet next.",

1012,,Gambler,Hehehe... This is the most exciting moment of all.,
1013,,Rogue,……,
1014,,Gambler,"All right, place your bet. Is it your sword? Or is it that thing you've been hiding under your arm? Oh, I'm really looking forward to it......",
1015,,Rogue,Haha...hahahahahahahahaha.,
1016,,,Rogue suddenly bursts out laughing.,
1017,,Gambler,...What's so funny?,
1018,,Rogue,"My most precious item, right?",

1029,,Rogue,"You only load a few bullets into the gun, leaving space in between and no one knows whether the next round will contain a bullet or not.",
1030,,Rogue,"As for how it's played? Put this gun to your head and pull the trigger, last one standing wins.",
1031,,Rogue,"How bout it? Thrilling, isn't it?",
1032,,Gambler,So your wager meant...,
1033,,Rogue,Exactly! My very own life!,
1034,,Rogue,"All right, I've pulled the trigger, now it's your turn!",
1035,,Gambler,This...,
1036,,Rogue,All you need to do is lift the gun to your temple and pull the trigger!,
1037,,Rogue,Go on! Didn't you say you wanted to take something precious from me?,
1038,,Rogue,Scared now? Scared that the trigger will be a bullet to end your life?!,
1039,,Gambler,There... There's no need for me to play this ridiculous game with you.,
1040,,Gambler,"Plus, what's the point of me taking your life. How will I get to witness you being robbed of your most valuable item if you die.",
1041,,Gambler,"Hmph, what a boring bet. Consider it a win for you. I've won enough for today anyway.",
1042,,Rogue,……,
1043,,Rogue,Phew...,
1044,,,After a while--,That was way too risky.
1045,,Rogue,Hahaha! You fell for it too.,What?
1046,,Rogue,The gun's not even loaded.,……
1047,,Rogue,Hah... She would've known if she just picked it up or asked to check it.,
1048,,Rogue,"But I acted as if I was going to attack her and instead pulled the trigger on myself, which threw her off her game.",
1049,,Rogue,"What happened next followed through rapidly, not giving her time to calm down and think.",
1050,,Rogue,"Once cowardice is shown, luck is useless.",
1051,,Rogue,"But this trick will only work once, I'm afraid she won't be fooled twice.",
1052,,Rogue,I'll have to think about how to deal with this later......,
1053,,Rogue,The good news is that I've figured out one thing so far...,
1054,,Rogue,"She doesn't have the conscious to take one's life, nor does she have the conscious to take her own life. That's the vast difference between us.",
1055,,Rogue,I guess... you guys can consider yourselves lucky.,I see...|It's not just about cheating.
1056,,Rogue,"Don't underestimate the wisdom of mercenaries. Also, what's cheating? It's called skill and strength!",
1057,,Rogue,"A battle is like a gamble in which you risk your life. Whether it's a fight or a gamble, you have to give it your all, and that's the way it should be.",
1058,,,Seems like Rogue's got her ways and is reliable after all.,
1059,,Rogue,Oh yea...,What?
1060,,Rogue,Can I borrow some money since I've just lost it all. Haha.,
1061,,,Nevermind what I just said. She's a lost cause.,
1062,1,???,Well then... time to reveal your destiny.,
1063,,,A mist of smoke spreads across a dim fortune-telling house and through the smoke a peculiarly dressed young girl with a mysterious aura can be seen.,
1064,,,And this young girl is planning to reveal my destiny from these five tarot cards lying on the table...,
1065,,???,The first card… the reverse of “The Tower”. A big change may occur in your current environment.,That's possibly true...
1066,,???,"The second card, the reverse of ""The Magician"". Um... This means...you might go astray?",Another reversed card?
1067,,???,"The third card, the reverse of ""The Lovers"".",I get the feeling... that it's not gonna be a good sign.
1068,,???,"Really? Don't worry, the results of the reading will only be revealed at the end. Um... What does this one mean again... umm... can't resist temptation?",Don't ask me... I wouldn't know.
1069,,???,"The fourth card... uh...this one means...! Although it's reversed, but this is ""The Star"" card!",Is that a good sign?
1070,,???,"Oh, because ""The Star"" is my favorite card! Look, it's drawn especially vivid, isn't it?",
1071,,???,"Because the stars are always talking to me, so I drew the stars according to my imagination!",...|…So the...fortune-telling...
1072,,???,"Oh...ahem, sorry. Well then, let's continue.",
1073,,,The fortune teller who ended her own mysterious aura that took much effort to create is called Vivian.,
1074,,,"It is said that her fortune-telling is quite accurate, although there is no sign of it so far.",
1075,,,"And if that were true, the current situation doesn't seem very good. I can only hope that the next card will show a good sign.",
1076,,Vivian,"The next card is... ""Death"".",Well... that's not a good sign at all.
1077,,Vivian,Hm~...although it's reversed. This card is slightly tricky...…,So it means...?
1078,,Vivian,Hmmmmmmm~~~~..............,
1079,,Vivian,"Sorry, I've forgotten how to read it, hehe.",……
1080,,Vivian,"But don't worry, I actually don't need these things to do fortune-telling!",
1081,,Vivian,I just ask the stars. That's how I usually do it anyways.,
1082,,Vivian,"Come on, you won't mind it, would you?",I...
1083,,,"Without waiting for my response, Vivian took the liberty and started her ""communication with the stars"".",
1084,,Vivian,Hmmmmmmm~~~~..............,
1085,,Vivian,"Ah, I have it! The stars have told me! A misfortune is upon you today!",I've already sensed that...
1086,,Vivian,As for the details... I'm not too sure about that.,
1087,,Vivian,It's decided then! I'm following you to see what will occur today!,
1088,,,...Is this what fortune-telling is like?,
1089,2,Vivian,Stare--,……
1090,,Vivian,Stare----,Ummm...
1091,,Vivian,Something wrong?,It's making me uncomfortable.
1092,,Vivian,"Ah, sorry. Then maybe I'll distant myself a bit, you can just pretend I'm not around.",
1093,,Vivian,"But we don't know what will happen, so I can't be too far.",Can't you get a more detailed answer from them?
1094,,Vivian,Wouldn't that be a spoiler? It'll take all the excitement out of the adventure!,What about my safety...
1095,,Vivian,"Hahaha, actually... it's also cause I wouldn't be able to get a more detailed answer.",
1096,,Vivian,Whether they'll answer or the type of answer given are all dependant on their mood. The stars can be quite temperamental.,
1097,,Vivian,"Anyways, I want to ask, where are you planning on heading now, Senpai?",Um... not particularly anywhere.
1098,,Vivian,"Ah, so you are quite free after all~",
1099,,Vivian,"But we can't just wander around like this, why don't we go find a safe and secure place?",
1100,,Rumpy,Hiss!!!,
1101,,Vivian,There are cats on campus? But it doesn't seem very friendly.,He's always been like that.
1102,,,"Although he is unfriendly on a usual basis, but today's reaction is a bit off.",
1103,,Rumpy,Meow ow!!,!?
1104,,,Rumpy extended his claw and clawed at us then rapidly scampered away.,
1105,,Vivian,"Senpai... you're not that compatible with cats, are you?",I don't think so.
1106,,Iron Fist,Senpai!? Are you okay?,Wh..where did the shivs...
1107,,Vivian,Better watch out...even shivs blocked off from a training battle can end up flying this way...,
1108,,Ithil,"Luckily no one was injured. It's dangerous to be close by during training practice, so it's best not to hang around here.","Yea, sure, got that..."
1109,,Ithil,"(But, how did my shivs end up in that direction? I wouldn't make such a blunder...)",
1110,,Succuba,It's not often that I use my love and blood as combined ingredients to make these lovable lunchboxes. But as long as I can get Senpai to eat this... ah ah ah ah ah.,
1111,,Succuba,But I haven't been able to find Senpai anywhere recently... Where could he possibly be?,
1112,,Succuba,"Hm? I smell Senpai's scent close by... ah ah ah ah... Oh, what a nostalgic scent.",
1113,,Succuba,"But... it's mixed with an unfamiliar smell... Bet it's another pest, better go get rid of it...",
1114,,Vivian,Senpai? I think someone's looking for you. Shall I signal them?,No no no no no!!!|RUN!!!
1115,,Fenrir,Urgh! So bored...,
1116,,Fenrir,So bored so bored so bored so bored so bored!!!!!!!,
1117,,Fenrir,"All these scaredy-cats, dodging me everywhere I go! Why is it so hard to even find someone to challenge!",
1118,,Fenrir,"Urgh, it could literally be ANYBODY. Just let me give someone a good beating!",
1119,,Fenrir,"Are there only the trees left around to vent my anger, huh? The more I think about it the angrier I get...! AAARRRRRGHHHHHH!!!!",
1120,,Vivian,Wow...! There's a person that can even pull up a tree and swing it about! That's amazing!,This is not the time to be standing around in awe!
1121,,Vivian,I didn't know Yume Academy is such an exciting place! Every day is like an adventure! So much fun!,"No no, something's off today..."
1122,,Vivian,"By the way, how did we land up here, is this still part of campus?",Not entirely...
1123,,Vivian,"An ancient castle... seems like there won't be anyone inside, perhaps you won't be in danger here.",Staying outside would be better.
1124,,Vivian,Oooh... and it looks very interesting! I've always wanted to see what a real castle looks like.,Hold on...
1125,,,"Without waiting for me to finish, Vivian ran into the castle on her own.",
1126,,,All she cares about is going on adventures...,
1127,3,Vivian,"Wow, the inside is bigger than I imagined.",And... we ended up inside...
1128,,Vivian,Uhh... Senpai...? Why are trembling with fear? Is there something dangerous in this castle?,
1129,,Vivian,"Could it be a floor that could crumble at any moment, a giant rolling stone, a trap full of spikes, or something like that...?",Worse.
1130,,???,Who's there...!!??,
1131,,Vivian,Eek!? This castle is inhabited by someone!?,"Strictly speaking, it is not a ""person""."
1132,,Vivian,Then... what is it!?,
1133,,Dracula,"Oh, look... it's Senpai... and the freshman? How dare you barge into my dorm room while I'm sleeping?","No, we're not in your room yet."
1134,,Dracula,"This is my dorm room! From the moment you set foot in this castle is my dormitory! No, from the forest outside is already my property!",That's so childish!
1135,,Dracula,"And even choosing to come when I'm not at my best, you've become despicable, Senpai...",
1136,,Dracula,I accidentally drank a lot of wine instead of blood yesterday and now I have a terrible headache...,
1137,,Dracula,I wanted to sleep in my coffin for weeks... and now you've come to disturb me...,"Sorry, we're already on our way out."
1138,,Dracula,Hold up! You can't just come as you please and leave as you please.,Then...
1139,,Dracula,Heh heh heh... I need to teach you a lesson for that and refill my blood bank at the same time...,As expected.
1140,,Vivian,Now I get it! This is today's misfortune that's occurring!,
1141,,Vivian,Thank goodness. I'm glad it's not too serious.,Not exactly the right time to say that.
1142,,Dracula,What are you whispering about! You better take me seriously!,
1143,,Dracula,Urgh... the hangover hasn't seemed to pass yet... uhhhh...,
1144,,Dracula,"My head hurts, it's dizzy... want to go back to sleep... aahhh...",
1145,,Dracula,"Just remember, when I wake up, I'll be settling the score!",
1146,,Dracula,Hmm... mmm... oohhh...,I hope she doesn't remember any of this after she wakes...
1147,,Vivian,Ahaha... well let's get Dracula back into her coffin.,
1148,,Vivian,I know! I'll ask if I can come explore after she wakes up!,So you haven't given up...
1149,,Vivian,Well... at least now we can be at ease!,
1150,,Vivian,The misfortune has occurred and it wasn't a terrible outcome. So congrats!,"No no, that happened clearly because of you..."
1151,,Vivian,"Are saying due to my accompaniment that resulted to this, Senpai?",Is it not?
1152,,Vivian,......,
1153,,Vivian,"Whether I was a part of it or not, the result of the fortune told will always occur.",
1154,,Vivian,Because that's what the stars told me... I've experienced it many times before and the stars have never been wrong.,
1155,,Vivian,"And that's why, if a misfortune is to occur, I have to take the responsibility to witness it till the end.",......
1156,,,Fortune-telling... is really complicated.,
1157,,Mika,What is this? A Clay Club?,It's a temporary club.
1158,,Mika,"Senpai, is this the reason that I've been summoned today?",Hmmm… How do I explain this.
1159,,Mika,"Yes, I would like to hear your explanation.",We're hoping that you can help us create \na new fun and educational school club.
1160,,Mika,……,
1161,,Mika,But I'm not a good teacher.,Umm...
1162,,Mika,I don't make clay dolls out of interest.,
1163,,Mika,"If you want to build an academy, wouldn't it be better to get someone that knows more about it?",Well…
1164,,,She's harder to convince than I thought.,
1165,,Mika,You seem troubled. What if I gave you this…?,
1166,,,It's a clay rabbit.,
1167,,Mika,"Even if I am not capable of fulfilling this task, I can provide you with some models to place there to attract club members.",But it won't be a heavy task.
1168,,Mika,"In order to attract club members, you would need to showcase your work first, right?",I think you're quite suitable for it.
1169,,,"You're eagerly helping, Mika.",
1170,,Mika,"Ah, what do you mean?",
1171,,,Could it be that you are interested after all?,
1172,,Mika,Architectural Design Competition…,It was probably KongMing's idea.
1173,,Mika,Is Yume Academy planning on constructing a new building?,Possibly…
1174,,,Whether it can be implemented or not is another matter.,
1175,,Mika,"I'm not good at it, but I could give it a try.",Great!
1176,,,"After all, it would be good for her to quickly settle in by taking part in school activities since she's only been here for a short time.",
1177,,Mika,"Creating deep attachments are a dangerous thing, but I understand your intention.",
1178,,Mika,But a competition needs a complete model.,
1179,,Mika,"First, I'll need a design sketch.",You have any ideas?
1180,,Mika,But where should I start…,I can show you around campus to get some inspiration.
1181,,Mika,That would be great! Thanks for the trouble.,
1182,,Mika,"The atmosphere here seems a bit too peaceful. If we could, I would like to explore further areas.",Then I'll show you the outskirts of campus.
1183,,Mika,Really?,There are also many reference books \nin the Grand Library too.
1184,,Mika,"Well, I'm sorry for having to trouble you then.",
1185,,Mika,"Let's head over. But once we've stepped outside of the school ground, I won't be able to constantly watch over your safety.",
1186,,Mika,So please be careful.,...?
1187,,Mika,"Wow, a place like this exists outside of Yume Academy?",
1188,,Mika,Seems like I've underestimated this place.,
1189,,Mika,But the atmosphere around here…,
1190,,Mika,Something's coming!,
1191,,？？？,Ahh---,
1192,,Mika,Watch out!,Be careful!
1193,,Mika,"Phew, luckily it's weak. I'm surprised that you reacted at the same time, I was quite impressed.",Thank you.
1194,,Mika,What is this place?,This is one of the girl's private castle.
1195,,Mika,Such a life of luxury. But this ancient castle doesn’t seem to have high-end taste in my opinion.,
1196,,Mika,Let's go check out the library then.,
1197,,,That was spoken casually out loud. Luckily Dracula wasn't present!,
1198,,Mika,"It might be strange of me asking,",
1199,,Mika,but would you mind walking in front of me on the way to the library?,
1200,,Mika,"I don't want you to disappear or be in danger, I can better protect you if you walk in front of me.",
1201,,,……,
1202,,,She's unexpectedly persistent.,
1203,,,(Rustling),
1204,,,But walking in front makes you conscious of what's happening at the back.,
1205,,,We're here---,
1206,,Mika,This is it?,Yep
1207,,Mika,I see… There are lots of great book collections here.,
1208,,Mika,"Although the world outside may be full of chaos, but…",
1209,,Mika,…it's surprisingly peaceful and calm in here.,Do you like the books?
1210,,Mika,They're great! There are many well-designed architecture books here.,
1211,,Mika,The décor is also much more grand than the strange-looking castle.,
1212,,,You don't have a grudge against the owner I hope?,
1213,,,"A few hours passed by quickly, and sure enough, Mika was engrossed in all the books.",
1214,,Mika,"Reading books is indeed a very pleasant experience. Next, let's head back and please stay in front of me….",
1215,,Mika,…as I'll worry if you walk behind me.,
1216,,,Did she have a bad encounter in this situation before?,
1217,,,The point of asking her to join the Clay Club (although it hasn't been formed) was to cheer her up.,
1218,,Mika,Senpai?,Why do I have to walk in front?
1219,,Mika,……,
1220,,Mika,It's a sad feeling when you turn back and there's no one left behind you anymore.,
1221,,Mika,I'm not strong enough to fully protect everyone.,
1222,,,Then---,
1223,,Mika,What are you doing?,Then let's walk side by side.
1224,,Mika,You…,"We're equal partners, you don't have to \nburden yourself by protecting me alone."
1225,,Mika,Guess it can't be helped then…,
1226,,Mika,"Then please stick by my side, we never know when something will attack.",
1227,,KongMing,This…,This---
1228,,KongMing,This is---,This is!!!
1229,,KongMing,"Senpai, weren't you the one that accompanied her? You must've seen these before, why are you acting surprised along with me?",
1230,,,——,"I'm just surprised, that's all!"
1231,,,It's a clay model of the academy.,
1232,,,But not only that...,
1233,,,Two figures stand in front of the main gate of Yume Academy with one undoubtingly resembling Mika.,
1234,,,And the other figure is…,
1235,,,…me?,
1236,,KongMing,How do I put this… Initially I just wanted to collect a few architectural models. But Mika's model is incredible.,
1237,,KongMing,"And this castle with it's aroma of books. Ah, combined together it has such a romantic feel.",……
1238,,,"Once again, I am glad Dracula is not present to hear this.",
1239,,KongMing,"Well then, I'll be taking the model.",
1240,,KongMing,"Oh right, she wanted me to give this to you.",
1241,,,"It was various types of flowers and plants, and clay statues in the shape of trees.",
1242,,,They were all the plants that we came across that day. I wasn't aware that she was so observant.,
1243,,KongMing,"This is the note she left for you. Well then, I'll be off.",
1244,,,I suddenly remembered that I seem to have forgotten to ask an important question.,Please wait a moment.
1245,,KongMing,What's wrong?,What expression did she have when she left?
1246,,KongMing,Take a guess.,
1247,,,That's mean.,
1248,,,"But from KongMing's smile, I think it's safe to assume that Mika left in high spirits.",
1249,,,I wonder what she wrote on the note?,
1250,,,"“Thank you for your accompaniment, please take these final products for display and I hope the Clay Club is a success!”",This girl…
1251,,,"“P.S. The campus scenery is beautiful and the buildings are exquisite. If you don’t mind, I would like you to show me around campus next time again.”",
1252,,,"Although she won't join the club, she's still quite concerned about it.",
1253,,,"Then again, if Mika doesn't join the club then there isn't a point in starting it anymore.",
1254,,,But I'm glad that Mika's finally cheered up now.,
1255,,,"""Estel is actually a thoughtful child.""",
1256,,,This was the phrase she always remembered.,
1257,,,"It's undeniable that she is often carefree. When being told, information often goes in the one ear and out the other.",
1258,,,"She's naughty, carefree and goes by her own ways.",
1259,,,"But occasionally there is a very, very attentive and caring side.",
1260,,,But this so-called caring side is hidden very very deep within.,
1261,,,For example ---,
1262,,*,"Estel, can you please… stop staring at the abandoned utility pole?",
1263,,Estel,Hmm? But isn't it abandoned?,
1264,,,"Yea, but you’re overdoing it and that makes me worried.",
1265,,Estel,"Oh, stop worrying! I’m not thinking about anything dangerous.",
1266,,,……,
1267,,Estel,Like... secretly blowing it up in a wonderful yet subtle way?,
1268,,,"If it's not something dangerous, then she's thinking about strange things.",
1269,,,I remember Nobunaga saying that she was adopted by a human family?,
1270,,Estel,"Yume Academy is so, so big---",
1271,,Estel,"It's so, so incredible---",
1272,,Estel,The buildings have been carefully designed.,
1273,,Estel,"In other words, if it were to all explode from a bomb at any angle... The wreckage would be beautiful.",
1274,,,…?,
1275,,,The things she say can be unbelievable at times…,
1276,,Estel,"I, Estel shall become the greatest bom… pyrotechnician in the future!",
1277,,*,"Ambition is great, but please don't come up with any dangerous ideas nor carry them out on top of that.",
1278,,Estel,"What do you mean by carrying them out, Senpai? Do you mean like blowing up the utility pole in fun ways?",
1279,,*,So you were thinking of it after all…,
1280,,Estel,"Senpai, Senpai, what's that?",
1281,,Estel,Can I blow it up?,
1282,,,I could vaguely make out a dirty-looking figure shaking from a distance.,
1283,,,That's…,
1284,,,CapsuGirl's pet,
1285,,,……,
1286,,,Luvly?,
1287,,,"No, that's… How do I explain it…",
1288,,*,Just don't blow it up ---,
1289,,,The situation seems strange.,
1290,,,Usually CapsuGirl always has her pet with her.,
1291,,,It's rare to see Luvly quivering all on its own.,
1292,,Estel,Oh! It's so cute!,
1293,,Estel,"Senpai, can I adopt it?",
1294,,*,"Hah,",
1295,,*,you would have to battle CapsuGirl for that. Whoever wins can get it.,
1296,,Estel,"Yes! Take Estel to meet CappuGirl, Senpai!",
1297,,*,"It's CapsuGirl, at least remember other people's names, will you? And I wasn't being serious, please don't go pick a fight with other students, otherwise, there will be serious consequences.",
1298,,Estel,Like what consequences?,
1299,,*,"Well, KongMing would be angry for sure.",
1300,,Estel,KongMing? Who's that? Someone powerful?,
1301,,*,"Just don't start a fight, otherwise Nobunaga will also be very angry.",
1302,,Estel,"Okay, I get it! Estel will be a good kid.",
1303,,,I wonder why Nobunaga has such a big influence on her.,
1304,,Estel,Why does this mysterious creature keep hovering over here?,
1305,,*,I heard that CapsuGirl had some business to sort out outside the academy and hasn't returned yet.,
1306,,Estel,Maybe she's lost? Estel is good at finding people who are lost.,
1307,,*,Lost?,
1308,,,"It never occurred to me that CapsuGirl would get lost and it's normal that she's been gone a while, but leaving Luvly alone behind…",
1309,,,That is a bit strange…,
1310,,Estel,"Senpai, Senpai, should we go look for CappuGirl? It looks like it wants to lead the way.",
1311,,,……,
1312,,,Luvly hovered around my legs and tugged at the hem of my pants.,
1313,,*,"I see… Also, it's CapsuGirl.",
1314,,,Estel traveled unexpectedly fast.,
1315,,,I had originally thought she was in poor health.,
1316,,,Who would've thought… she's unexpectedly quick and agile.,
1317,,Estel,"Senpai, Senpai, you're so slow!",
1318,,Estel,"Just like mama and papa! If I were to run at full speed, I'd be far away, but then you guys wouldn't be able to keep up!",
1319,,,She seemed disappointed for a second.,
1320,,,"Although it was just a second, but there's no mistaking it.",
1321,,,It was…,
1322,,,an expression of regret.,
1323,,Estel,Mama and papa use to take Estel to play in the forest.,
1324,,Estel,And then often... often there would be small children lost in the forest. That was also the time when I brought them back!,
1325,,,That sounds... impressive…,
1326,,Estel,And then they would be crying loudly…,
1327,,Estel,That's when I would take out my tiny fireworks to show them.,
1328,,Estel,And they would suddenly --- suddenly stop crying!,
1329,,,"I'm surprised, I thought she was just another naughty kid.",
1330,,Estel,"So if CapsuGirl cries later, I can also show her my fireworks!",
1331,,,That's okay… Just imagining it seems dangerous.,
1332,,,"Or should I say, it's harder to imagine Estel caring for others?",
1333,,,"Or even worse, imagining CapsuGirl crying...",
1334,,,But Estel's actually quite caring.,
1335,,Estel,You're gonna pay if you think that I can only cause trouble!,
1336,,*,Pay?,
1337,,Estel,I'm gonna set explosive bombs in your dorm!,
1338,,,Did she…. just say.. bombs… and not…fireworks?,
1339,,Estel,Ah! The person in that cave is…,It's ---
1340,,CapsuGirl,"Ah, Senpai, why are you looking at me like that?",
1341,,*,……,What are you doing here?|Perhaps an explanation would be good?
1342,,CapsuGirl,"Ah, it's these babies…",
1343,,,"She lifted her arm and surprising enough,",
1344,,,in this barren rocky cave there was a bird nest.,
1345,,CapsuGirl,If I leave… these babies will…,
1346,,,She lifted her arm and tiny little yellow figures appeared.,
1347,,,These are…,
1348,,,They can even survive here?,
1349,,Estel,They're so cute!!,
1350,,CapsuGirl,"There's heavy magic in the atmosphere here, they're only able to survive because of the protection of the cave.",
1351,,CapsuGirl,"But the cave is also too barren, there is barely any light.",
1352,,CapsuGirl,"Besides the light, there isn't enough air flow and even with the tiny amount of air passing through, it is mixed with heavy magic…",
1353,,CapsuGirl,So I thought about creating a sustainable environment for them to survive and sent Luvly back to the academy to bring someone over to help.,
1354,,CapsuGirl,But how did I end up with Senpai…,
1355,,*,"Well, I'm so sorry that it's me.",
1356,,,"It seems like the one that was lost wasn't CapsuGirl,",
1357,,,but her pet.,
1358,,Estel,Your pet is called Luvly? Luvly is so cute!,
1359,,Estel,"Senpai may not be of help, but I'm pretty good at this! Can I help?",
1360,,,"What does ""may not be of help"" mean?",
1361,,Estel,"When I was living with mama and papa, the neighbor who was really nice to me was a veterinarian!",
1362,,Estel,I'm quite familiar with helping animals to survive!,
1363,,,A few minutes later…,
1364,,CapsuGirl,"Wow, it's unbelievable that this simple device was created in such a short time.",
1365,,,"A device that can ventilate and purify polluted air… In other words, it’s an air purifier?",
1366,,,No wonder she gets special admission…,
1367,,CapsuGirl,Now all we have to do is regularly come back to clean the device.,
1368,,CapsuGirl,You're actually quite thoughtful.,
1369,,Estel,"It's nothing compared to what mama and papa can do. But at this level, Estel can do it too!",
1370,,Estel,But my firework-making talent will forever be unmatched!,
1371,,CapsuGirl,"""Mama and papa?"" Your parents? What are they like?",
1372,,,Good question… I'm quite curious too.,
1373,,Estel,Wonderful! Wonderful people! Just like Nobunaga!,
1374,,Estel,They are gentle and powerful!,
1375,,,"""What should we do?""",
1376,,,"""She's being outcasted but she has to survive.""",
1377,,,"""If that's the case, what a shame… This poor child.""",
1378,,,"""Should we really treat her as a child?""",
1379,,,"There are many, many voices in her memory.",
1380,,,In the vast years that she has lived were filled with all sorts of voices.,
1381,,,"But for Estel, she would sometimes subconsciously filter out the noises.",
1382,,Estel,Filter the bad and you will only have the good voices remaining!,
1383,,,"To Estel, her adoptive parents were those good voices that remained.",
1384,,,"Of course, there were also some unpleasant voices.",
1385,,,"""Why does their child never grow up?""",
1386,,,"""Could she be… one of the legendary warrior girls?""",
1387,,,"""If she can be used for research... Ah, they might have heard us.""",
1388,,,I remember mama uttering these words to herself before she departed.,
1389,,,"""Estel, remember to venture further into the vast world.""",
1390,,Estel,"Understood, mama!",
1391,,,"The vast world, the vast world.",
1392,,*,Were you lost in thought?,
1393,,Estel,I was just thinking about the past.,
1394,,Estel,Mama and papa told Estel to become stronger so that Estel can protect what must be protected.,
1395,,Estel,"Then I met Nobunaga, and you, Senpai.",
1396,,Estel,And CappuGirl!,
1397,,CapsuGirl,……,
1398,,Estel,Estel is sooooo happy!,
1399,,Estel,"Estel felt lonely when she was separated from mama and papa, but she is brave!",
1400,,Estel,So she set out on the journey ahead and met Nobunaga and Senpai.,
1401,,Estel,Estel will meet lots of great friends at Yume Academy right?,
1402,,,Well…,
1403,,,She's remains quite energetic when she laughs,
1404,,,From her beaming smile radiates happiness.,
1405,,,"As I subconsciously stretched out my hand,",
1406,,,another hand stretched out at the same time towards her.,
1407,,CapsuGirl,"My name's CapsuGirl, it's nice to meet you.",
1408,,*,Come on now--- Estel!,
1409,,,"""Just like that time with Senpai and Nobunaga!""",
1410,,,She pulled mine and CapsuGirl's hands as she said it.,
1411,,,I looked down at her hands grabbing mine.,
1412,,,"Two hands clasping one another, I wonder if it is the same warmth that she felt before.",
1413,,Estel,……,
1414,,,"""Dear child… grab onto my hand and let me take you home.""",
1415,,,"""Hello Estel, I'm Nobunaga. Please come with me to Yume Academy.""",
1416,,,"""Hi Estel, I'm *. Welcome to Yume Academy.""",
1417,,,"Mama, papa, is this what companionship is like?",
1418,,,Where will my end destination be?,
1419,,,"For the first time, I'm feeling excited!",
1420,,,Whether it is the present or the future.,
1421,,Estel,I am Estel and I'm very happy to join Yume Academy!,
1422,,,The moth in the dark abyss.,
1423,,,Also has the chance to see the light of day.,
1424,,,The sunlight in the abyss.,
1425,,,Can surprisingly be dazzling too…,
1426,,,Senpai…,
1427,,,Although it may be cliché to say this.,
1428,,,But from the day I met you.,
1429,,,I don't seem to have to be the moth that can only live in the dark anymore…,
1430,,Blair,Is this for me to wear?,
1431,,*,"Yea, probably. When Vera heard that a new student is coming, she happily went and sewed a new uniform for you.",
1432,,,Of course.,
1433,,,It might also be due to her trying to recruit members to form a new clothing society.,
1434,,,"After all, there isn't anyone that wants to join currently, so she can only hope that the new students would be interested.",
1435,,Blair,Vera? Who's THAT?,
1436,,*,Is it me or did your tone suddenly get a bit aggressive?,
1437,,Blair,Is it a girl? So it's true that there are only girls at Yume Academy.,
1438,,*,……,
1439,,,She sounds annoyed…,
1440,,Blair,"Damn it, how dare they desire what is mine!",
1441,,*,"Claire… it's okay, you can calm down.",
1442,,*,We're all school mates.,
1443,,Blair,It's Blair.,
1444,,*,Clair…,
1445,,Blair,(Annoyed expression),
1446,,*,I mean Blair! Let's hurry back to Yume Academy.,
1447,,Blair,"Okay, Senpai.",
1448,,*,……,
1449,,,I hope I'm not bringing trouble back to Yume Academy with me.,
1450,,,For someone who is used to darkness wouldn't be use to walking under daylight right?,
1451,,,Da…darkness…,
1452,,,I don't know if she'll fit in at Yume Academy.,
1453,,,"Ah, but it'll be a piece of cake for Kong Ming to help her fit in if she needs.",
1454,,KongMing,A---choo!,
1455,,Michael,Bless you! Have you caught a cold?,
1456,,KongMing,In this weather… I doubt it.,
1457,,KongMing,……,
1458,,*,……,
1459,,Blair,……,
1460,,,An awkward silence.,
1461,,KongMing,Someone is blatantly staring at me.,
1462,,*,"Yep, you're not wrong about that…",
1463,,Blair,Who are YOU!,
1464,,KongMing,"Excuse me? I am the president of the Student Union, my name is KongMi---",
1465,,Blair,Take that!,
1466,,*,An attack?!,
1467,,KongMing,……,
1468,,Blair,"Able to dodge my attack, not bad. Seems like you've got some skills.",
1469,,KongMing,"Hey, I'll call the Discipline Committee on you.",
1470,,*,Wait! This is a misunderstanding!,
1471,,KongMing,……,
1472,,KongMing,What are you thinking bringing such a dangerous person back with you?,
1473,,*,We're all on the same side…,
1474,,Blair,You! How dare you speak to my Senpai like that!,
1475,,KongMing,M-Y S-E-N-P-A-I?,
1476,,*,"I've told you a dozen times, please don't call me like that. As for KongMing, you must've been mistaken, please don't give me that look.",
1477,,Blair,Senpai… but aren't you mine? I can't call you that anymore?,
1478,,*,Eek! Ain't the atmosphere dark and scary all of a sudden! Sure! Call me whatever you like… Claire!,
1479,,Blair,It's Blair!,
1480,,*,"I mean, Blair!",
1481,,Blair,Okie~ MY Senpai is the sweetest~,
1482,,Blair,"Well then, will you be the one to show me around campus, dear?",
1483,,*,Dear...?,
1484,,KongMing,Why don't you consider taking her to see Raphael too?,
1485,,Blair,Raphael? Who is THAT!,
1486,,*,Eek! The atmosphere is cold and scary again! Let's rather not… besides I don't think Raphael can fix this problem.,
1487,,KongMing,"Well then, please go ahead and show her around Yume Academy, it anyways seems like she doesn't want anyone else to show her around.",
1488,,Blair,"That's right, I can't accept anyone else besides dearest Senpai over here, you've got the brains although you can be quite annoying.",
1489,,KongMing,Annoying…?! Because you think I will steal Senpai away from you?,
1490,,Blair,"Yes, and stop getting so close to him, I don't like it. Don't make me start a war…",
1491,,*,……,
1492,,KongMing,"Well, I have to break it to you, but I'm not interested in YOUR ""dearest"". So, enjoy your campus tour~",
1493,,*,"Enjoy? I don't feel like I'm enjoying anything right now, I think you're the one that's enjoying the show, Kong Ming.",
1494,,Blair,Wow~ The cherry blossoms are so beautiful here~,
1495,,Blair,"And over here too~ Dear, what do you think?",
1496,,*,……,
1497,,Blair,"Ah, you're sweating? Is it too warm out here?",
1498,,*,"No… I just think… you don't have to call me ""dear""…",
1499,,*,Or… whatever… whatever makes you happy.,
1500,,,Best not to risk my life.,
1501,,Blair,Okie dear~ Then let's go~,
1502,,,An assassin squad…,
1503,,,Who would've thought that she's an assassin.,
1504,,,Hard to believe.,
1505,,,Perhaps that is where her extreme personality came from?,
1506,,,Although bringing her here from an assassin squad may also have been a bit extreme too…,
1507,,*,Say…,
1508,,Blair,"What's wrong, dear?",
1509,,*,"Hmm… I'm not sure if I should ask this, but what was your life like back then?",
1510,,Blair,"Oh my, are you curious about me?",
1511,,*,"Not… well… yea, you can say so…",
1512,,*,"So, will you tell me?",
1513,,Blair,"Well, if it's you, then it's okay.",
1514,,,All that I could remember was a dark sky.,
1515,,,"Just as bats that don't come out during the day, it's the same for assassins.",
1516,,,We do not see daybreak.,
1517,,,Bats do not like the light and assassins don't yearn for sunlight either.,
1518,,,We never cared for any living thing.,
1519,,,The greatest tribute to life is to let them die quick and clean.,
1520,,,"In my eyes, all living things are useless, worthless, that can be forsaken at any time and killed off.",
1521,,,"The process of killing is just a process of ""taking"".",
1522,,,"Whether it's ""Blair"" or ""the assassin"", these identities do not require emotion.",
1523,,,"When I get paid, all I need to do is kill…",
1524,,,Despite that,
1525,,,Despite that…,
1526,,,The light that shines into the depths is dazzling.,
1527,,,Although my existence and Senpai's existence may be vastly different.,
1528,,,"But, just like a moth…",
1529,,,"Even if it doesn't need the flame, it is constantly attracted to it.",
1530,,Blair,"What's the matter, dear? Why the expression?",
1531,,Blair,"You don't have to feel sad for me. If you're sad, I'd be sad too.",
1532,,,Assassination gets boring.,
1533,,,To be liberated from those boring days,
1534,,,"If one had to describe what ""light"" is like as a person, it would be you.",
1535,,,"Life, from when it is born to when it ends, holds no value.",
1536,,,For whatever identity I choose.,
1537,,,But you… on the other hand...,
1538,,,"Your ""life"" is different",
1539,,Blair,Promise me this,
1540,,Blair,"that you'll never, ever leave me---",
1541,,Blair,Because there would be no point living in this world without you. What's that look? You think I'm joking?,
1542,,Blair,To me…... You are the most important to me!,
1543,,*,……,
1544,,,Blair's a girl of many stories.,
1545,,,But what could this attachment be?,
1546,,,Perhaps it's like a duckling imprinting on the first person they see.,
1547,,,Although it can be a bit of a headache.,
1548,,Blair,From your expression I can tell that it may be a bit hard for you to understand.,
1549,,,"Like a bee to the blossom, a moth to the flame",
1550,,,You are the light upon the candlestick,
1551,,,It is an inescapable fate,
1552,,,in order to sustain this life.,
1553,,,"That is why, my dear, precious, one and only Senpai, that it is important for me to be close to you.",
1554,,*,Oh ---,
1555,,*,We're outside Yume Academy.,
1556,,*,But this route is also a shortcut to the Grand Library.,
1557,,*,"Oh right, Blair! You---",
1558,,,All I know is that she's a Girl,
1559,,,with exceptional power in battle.,
1560,,,But this exceptional power emerged from her past as an assassin.,
1561,,,But I don't know what her strength is against Chaos creatures.,
1562,,,But if I just ask about it out of the blue might seem a bit…,
1563,,Blair,You! What are you planning to do to my dearest!,
1564,,*,Roselle?,
1565,,,"That is Roselle, right?",
1566,,,"No, she's an infected Roselle.",
1567,,Blair,Ha!,
1568,,*,Wait! Don't hurt her!,
1569,,Blair,"Dear? What is your relationship to her, why can't I hurt her.",
1570,,*,How do I explain it? We're all classmates?,
1571,,*,You shouldn't harm your classmates.,
1572,,Blair,What's that over there?,
1573,,*,Chaos creatures. Coincidental.,
1574,,Blair,And YOU want to hurt my dearest too?,
1575,,*,——,
1576,,,Just now…,
1577,,,It happened so fast.,
1578,,,What impressive assassin skills.,
1579,,*,I didn't even see what was going on yet.,
1580,,Blair,"Ah, did I scare you, dear?",
1581,,Blair,Actually I could've killed it in a way way more elegant manner.,
1582,,Blair,But I was scared it was gonna hurt you...,
1583,,KongMing,That was...,
1584,,KongMing,amazing.,
1585,,*,"Kong Ming, why're you here?",
1586,,KongMing,Happened to pass by.,
1587,,Blair,"Ah, the annoying Girl has finally said something nice, but in front of my dearest, you can praise me even more, such as ""oh, you are so gifted, Blair!""",
1588,,KongMing,The person who hasn't said anything nice is you...,
1589,,KongMing,"Hah, Yume Academy has a gained a brat, but I guess we need you.",
1590,,Blair,"Such ""sweet"" words are harmless to me~ Only my dearest matters. Such lives like yours are meaningless to me.",
1591,,KongMing,You are really a headache...,
1592,,KongMing,"Well then, take care of her, her ""dearest"" Senpai~",
1593,,,You sure you don't want to stay for the show?,
1594,,Blair,"Well then, dearest, let's continue the tour~",
1595,,Blair,"Does this count as a date? A date? Should be a date, right~",
1596,,*,——……,
1597,,,"Ah, Senpai doesn't know yet.",
1598,,,The only purpose the old Blair lived for was to be an assassin.,
1599,,,I never believed in equality amongst living beings if one had to say there was any.,
1600,,,They would just get killed by me and I spared no lives.,
1601,,,But to the current Blair.,
1602,,,The purpose that I now survive for is to be with Senpai.,
1603,,,"The last thing I want is death. Ironically, since I was the one who brought it upon others and yet I am the one afraid of it now.",
1604,,,But under only one circumstance will I accept death.,
1605,,Blair,"Until death will we part… No, even death cannot keep us a part.",
1606,,Blair,"I'm now excited for what's to come at Yume Academy with you, dear.",
1607,,,If Lady Luck exists in this world…,
1608,,,…I hope she hears my prayers.,
1609,,,I didn't want this to happen.,
1610,,,Why is this happening to me…,
1611,,Teresa,"Ha! You just fainted, didn't you?",
1612,,*,……,
1613,,*,...,
1614,,,…I didn't. Although I really want to if that's possible.,
1615,,,I really don't want to face reality.,
1616,,*,"If I close my eyes, I can pretend none of this is happening.",
1617,,Teresa,Hey! You there! Eyes on the target!,
1618,,Rogue,Say that to yourself. There's no other witness here.,
1619,,*,……,
1620,,,Time: Sunday Morning,
1621,,,Setting: Church of Violence,
1622,,,Characters: Me and this Nun that came out of nowhere,
1623,,,Plot: The nun tied me up to a wooden stake so she can test her knife-throwing skills,
1624,,,…versus Rogue.,
1625,,,…The target is an apple on my head.,
1626,,*,I'm pretty sure I read the same story in another novel…,
1627,,,Why are they gambling in Church?!,
1628,,,I thought this was a sacred place!,
1629,,,Sacred!,
1630,,Teresa,Shut up! Why can't we gamble in Church? Are you looking down on Churches?,
1631,,*,I'm looking down on gambling…,
1632,,*,"God, please help me.",
1633,,Teresa,God won't help you. It's just me!,
1634,,*,……,
1635,,,I would never understand how did someone like her become a nun.,
1636,,Teresa,Here's my wager. Winners take all!,
1637,,Rogue,You're pretty brave to wager this much.,
1638,,Rogue,Did you forget what happened before?,
1639,,*,…What do you mean?,
1640,,Rogue,"Ha, you agreed to help without knowing anything?",
1641,,*,"I didn't agree to any of this, I was kidnapped!",
1642,,Rogue,Teresa loses almost every gamble. You're such a good friend to agree to help her with this.,
1643,,*,……,
1644,,*,Please tell me this is not real.,
1645,,,Two hours later.,
1646,,Rogue,You're actually good…or this one here is very lucky.,
1647,,*,Hmmph! (Muffled),
1648,,Teresa,This apple is skilled at dodging knifes.,
1649,,*,"Hmmph! (""You're just bad at this! Just stop!"")",
1650,,,I am surrounded by sharp blades…I don't dare to move a muscle in case I hurt myself.,
1651,,Rogue,"Alright, Teresa, I'll be off. I need to help Librarian with her books.",
1652,,*,Can you please free me before leaving? And why are you helping Librarian?,
1653,,Rogue,"I'm not a sore loser, and I lost to Librarian. She's good. Very good.",
1654,,*,Good…at Gambling? Is this the same Librarian that I know?,
1655,,Teresa,Helping Librarian? Count me in!,
1656,,*,————,
1657,,*,You seem to look up to Librarian.,
1658,,Teresa,"Of course, who wouldn't? I won't waste my breath on explaining, since I don't plan on looking up at you anytime soon.",
1659,,,"Watching them leave, all I wanted to say was:",
1660,,,"I don't mind if you don't free me,",
1661,,,"I also won't mind not knowing why do you like Librarian that much,",
1662,,,And it's also okay for me if you just leave me here.,
1663,,,But why you decide to gag my mouth before you lea---,
1664,,,At least let me cry for help!,
1665,,,……,
1666,,,"In the end,",
1667,,,it was Uriel who freed me.,
1668,,,"If possible,",
1669,,,I don't want to meet Teresa again. Ever.,
1670,,,……,
1671,,,...Hmm?,
1672,,,Am I seeing what I think I'm looking at…?,
1673,,,"Nah, I must be seeing things.",
1674,,*,"Let me just close the door and open it again, I'm sure everything will go back to normal…",
1675,,KongMing,"What do you think you're doing, Senpai?",
1676,,*,"Oh, it's Kongming. Good morning!",
1677,,KongMing,Good morning! You look hyper today!,
1678,,*,"Well, hyper-ventilating would be the correct word. Why is SHE here?",
1679,,,That person,
1680,,,sitting on the sofa,
1681,,,what's her name again?,
1682,,,Was it Teresa?,
1683,,KongMing,"Oh, you must be talking about Teresa. Uriel wrote a letter of recommendation for her. She used to be in charge of the Church of Violence, and seems alright.",
1684,,*,The Church of Violence?,
1685,,,Is this even legal?,
1686,,KongMing,I did remember Uriel talking about you being close. Why don't you show her around Campus?,
1687,,*,"Well, that IS what I do for newcomers...though I feel like I might need to talk to Uriel about the definition of ""close"" later.",
1688,,KongMing,"Ah, so you're more than close?",
1689,,*,With whom?,
1690,,Teresa,"You can say that. We did meet each other in a life or death situation after all. So you're Senpai? Show me around the Campus then, like a good Senpai should.",
1691,,*,"More like a situation that almost caused me to lose my life, I'd say.",
1692,,KongMing,"Glad to see you two getting along. Now off you go, I have other Student Council matters to deal with.",
1693,,*,"Sure, sure, President KongMing. By the way, Teresa, don't tie me up this time.",
1694,,Teresa,Of course!,
1695,,*,……,
1696,,,I don't get her.,
1697,,,Where do we start…,
1698,,,"Usually, I'd show the newcomer the Main Street.",
1699,,,But nothing good happened when I did that.,
1700,,,I'll start from the Library this time.,
1701,,*,"As the saying goes, ""Books are the ladder of human progress."" So we're heading for the Library first.",
1702,,Teresa,I never heard that before. Are you sure you didn't make that up?,
1703,,*,I'm pretty sure I read that somewhere. What will you know anyway? You probably don't read at all.,
1704,,Teresa,"I feel insulted. While I won't call myself a bookworm, I do read. Quite a lot.",
1705,,*,？,
1706,,Teresa,"You see, I always wanted to chat with Librarian, and the topic of books will inevitably come up sometime, right?",
1707,,*,……？,
1708,,,What's with this girl and Librarian?,
1709,,Teresa,"Hmm, such a rich aroma…",
1710,,*,！,
1711,,Teresa,What are you looking at? Can't you smell the fragrance in the air?,
1712,,*,"Uh, no?",
1713,,Teresa,…It's wine! Of the highest quality! Here I come! (Running towards the Main Street),
1714,,,And an alcoholic too. How surprising.,
1715,,Teresa,Hmm…do you want some? You sure need loosening up a bit.,
1716,,*,…I'll pass. It's just…not everyone takes wine with Spicy Fishies. I'm impressed.,
1717,,Teresa,"Don't be, you're getting me embarassed. Now loosen up a bit, have some wine.",
1718,,*,"Sure, but do you mind telling me why can't you buy wine like everyone else does?",
1719,,*,"Why do you have to gamble for it, and why did you wager MY labor?",
1720,,Teresa,"You see, I don't have anything else to wager, that's why.",
1721,,*,"I can't start a fight with a girl, I can't start a fight with a girl…",
1722,,Teresa,But you just did to the shop owner?,
1723,,,……,
1724,,,I had no choice.,
1725,,,You lost a year and a half's worth of my labor there.,
1726,,,I feel so guilty now.,
1727,,Teresa,Where else do you want to show me? I'm starting to feel like I might like this place after all.,
1728,,*,I sincerely hope the shop owner won't complain to KongMing about me…,
1729,,Teresa,"Oh, stop thinking about it. Here, have some Spicy Fishies, they are my favorite.",
1730,,*,……,
1731,,*,Easy to say when you're the one that caused all this.,
1732,,,I really don't get what Teresa is thinking.,
1733,,Teresa,"Oooh, a Sunglasses Fair! Yume Academy is full of pleasant surprises, I must admit.",
1734,,Teresa,"Don't go anywhere, I'll be back in a bit.",
1735,,*,Annnd off she goes.,
1736,,,A few moments later,
1737,,Uriel,"Hello, Senpai. Why are you counting ants on the ground?",
1738,,*,"Hello, Uriel. Mind telling me why did you say that I was ""close"" with Teresa?",
1739,,Uriel,Teresa? She's a very kind person. Did she make you angry?,
1740,,*,"…Define ""kind"".",
1741,,Uriel,"Well, she DID help fixing the collapsed houses of the Church…",
1742,,*,…the ones that she helped breaking?,
1743,,Uriel,And she always shared her favorite snack with others…,
1744,,*,…which was way too spicy and caused other girls to have stomach aches?,
1745,,Uriel,"…And many others. Look, Senpai, she has many redeeming features!",
1746,,*,"I find them rather hard to notice, especially when she tied me up in the past…",
1747,,Uriel,"Well, Teresa can be infuriating at times, and she really need to hone her social skills, but she is kind at heart. Some practice, and she'll be as good as everyone else. Alright, I need to be at somewhere else. See you later~",
1748,,,……,
1749,,,Uriel left.,
1750,,,Without convincing me of,
1751,,,Teresa's kindness.,
1752,,,Does it even exist?,
1753,,Teresa,Senpai! Look at me. Don't I look cool in these sunglasses?,
1754,,*,……,
1755,,,Her smile is blinding. I almost missed the angry person coming this way…are they holding a weapon?,
1756,,,"Wait, isn't this the supervisor of the Sunglasses Fair?",
1757,,*,What did you do???,
1758,,Teresa,Now that was fun.,
1759,,*,I don't want to do this again. Paying for that really hurts my wallet.,
1760,,Teresa,"Come on, Senpai! Don't tell me you didn't have fun after ""exercising""!",
1761,,*,You call that exercise?,
1762,,Teresa,"Come on, don't be a killjoy.",
1763,,*,You're killing all my joy…,
1764,,Teresa,Don't be this way. Do you know how the Church of Violence came into being?,
1765,,*,"Good question, I do want to know how.",
1766,,Teresa,"Well, here's how things went. One of our friends had a nervous breakdown…",
1767,,,That was a very encouraging start.,
1768,,Teresa,…so did Uriel and the others. Everyone was so sad…,
1769,,Teresa,But they're still alive. They have the chance to make a difference.,
1770,,Teresa,"People come to the Church to confess everyday. They are either depressed, or stressed out, or both.",
1771,,,"Her tone was light, but…",
1772,,,…her expression was glum.,
1773,,Teresa,Just praying to God won't changing anything.,
1774,,Teresa,They just don't understand…,
1775,,Teresa,…The only one who can change them are themselves.,
1776,,Teresa,Uriel was always so self-critical. It wasn't her fault at all…I couldn't stand to see my loved ones like that.,
1777,,Teresa,"I am a nun. Nun Teresa. A nun has her responsabilities, but I tend to lose patience when fulfilling them.",
1778,,*,...,
1779,,Teresa,I read from a book that others will feel your kindness if you shared what you like with them.,
1780,,*,……,
1781,,,And the Spicy Fishies incident happened?,
1782,,Teresa,"And then I remembered another book saying that everything comes at a price, so I asked them to give me something in return for the Fishies…",
1783,,*,……。,
1784,,,…Just when I was impressed by your thoughtfulness.,
1785,,Teresa,"Fighting over talking, that's how you get close to others!",
1786,,*,That's how you get yourself in the Infirmary. Raphael won't be glad when she learns about this…,
1787,,Teresa,"Therefore, let's fight!",
1788,,*,…What did you say?,
1789,,Teresa,Let's have a heart-to-heart! With our fists!,
1790,,*,Nooooooooo!,
1791,,Teresa,How about now? Don't you feel better now?,
1792,,*,…So all you wanted…was to make me happy?,
1793,,Teresa,You seemed pretty down.,
1794,,*,...,
1795,,*,That's why she acted this way…,
1796,,Teresa,Do you feel better now?,
1797,,*,…Yes.,
1798,,,It's just like what Uriel said: Teresa is a very kind person.,
1799,,,Though she does need to learn more social skills.,
1800,,Teresa,"Now that Senpai finally smiled,",
1801,,Teresa,I need to spread the happiness! First step to doing that would be creating a Fight Club to help others too!,
1802,,*,……,
1803,,,Did I smile?,
1804,,,"She seems alright after all…Wait a minute, what did she just say?",
1805,,*,"KongMing, I don't feel good about this…not a bit…",
1806,,,Yume Academy is peaceful as usual today.,
1807,,,I'm the Senpai of the Girls in the Academy.,
1808,,,"And judging from the bandages on my body,",
1809,,,"you can totally tell how ""great"" I feel right now! I'm currently in Raphael's infirmary getting treated!",
1810,,,"And the disaster-of-it-all is now talking ""happily"" with KongMing.",
1811,,Frexie,"Hi there! My name is Frexie! I'm here to see Lucifer, please do tell her that I've been a huge fan!!!",
1812,,Angelica,You mentioned Luna right? Can I find her here?,
1813,,KongMing,……,
1814,,KongMing,Can you let us finish the statement first?,
1815,,KongMing,Who knocked him first?,
1816,,Frexie,Wut...?,
1817,,Angelica,I beg your pardon?,
1818,,Frexie,"Oh, you're still talking about the crash. But we've brought him here already.",
1819,,Angelica,"Oh, about him. Is he still alive?",
1820,,KongMing,"Raphael, please hold him down. We can't let him get up.",
1821,,KongMing,"So, when Senpai was taking a walk, Miss Frexie rushed out from nowhere and knocked him far ahead.",
1822,,KongMing,"And after a few hundreds meters of ""flight"", Senpai took a hard landing on the ground and passed out. Then Angelica found him and took him to the infirmary, correct?",
1823,,*,#@#￥&......,
1824,,KongMing,Please say something I can understand.,
1825,,Raphael,Senpai is not able to speak properly right now. The brain concussion made him too dizzy.,
1826,,KongMing,So I ask you not do this again. Rushing at full speed everywhere can be extremely dangerous. You can only do that on the field.,
1827,,Raphael,"That explains Senpai's brain concussion. But the serious bruise, however, might be caused by something else. It looks like someone dragged Senpai's body all the way here.",
1828,,Kong Ming,……,
1829,,Angelica,"Oh, I thought Senpai was dead. Besides, the body is too big to be hung on my bow, so I had no other choice.",
1830,,KongMing,(These two are mindless.),
1831,,Raphael,(They really need to be more mindful.),
1832,,*,……！#@￥%￥#……,
1833,,Raphael,"Senpai! Please calm down, getting agitated is bad for your recovery.",
1834,,KongMing,"Apart from having nine lives, he's really not that smart.",
1835,,Raphael,"If you really need to say things like this, please leave it after Senpai is fully recovered...",
1836,,,I am their Senpai,
1837,,,And this is Yume Academy.,
1838,,,"I'm totally ""fine""",
1839,,,"And I'm ""not"" getting angry",
1840,,,"If you're listening, please don't worry about me.",
1841,,KongMing,Why do you look so upset?,
1842,,*,……,
1843,,KongMing,They've already apologized for what they've done. Now it's time for you to behave like a real Senpai and show them around the campus.,
1844,,*,……,
1845,,Frexie,She's got a point. I've apologized for knocking you over. Now it's your turn to apologize to me for being too tiny to notice and then I'll mercifully accept your apology.,
1846,,*,Mercifully?,
1847,,Angelica,"I'm very sorry, Senpai. I should not have naively decided that there was no longer hope, even if you did look like you were dead at the time. I really should have hit you again to see if you were still alive and I will take care to do this in the future.",
1848,,*,That's more like making a second kill!!!,
1849,,KongMing,"See, they've already apologized. You should forgive them.",
1850,,*,Listen carefully. YOU CANNOT CALL THAT AN APOLOGY!,
1851,,KongMing,"You might as well put up with it. So now it's time for you to show the new girls around campus, like you always do.",
1852,,*,I'm really starting to regret taking on this job.,
1853,,*,"By the way, do you have any insurance or anything? I really need to prevent myself from ending up in the infirmary for a second time.",
1854,,KongMing,"Don't worry, you won't be harmed again... most likely. Maybe you can ask Raphael to come with you?",
1855,,Raphael,"Sorry, Senpai. But as you see, there're other patients, so I cannot leave my infirmary that easily.",
1856,,*,"Fine, I refuse to show them around.",
1857,,KongMing,"Unfortunately, you cannot refuse this order, Senpai. Otherwise you might find Frexie ""helping"" you out during the anniversary celebration.",
1858,,*,……,
1859,,,I'm the Senpai of the Girls in the Academy.,
1860,,,And I have this feeling,
1861,,,The peace of this beautiful academy,
1862,,,Is about to be broken,
1863,,*,Please don't get any closer.,
1864,,Frexie,"But seriously? If you go any further, I might miss sight of you again!",
1865,,Angelica,"She's got a point, Senpai, we might lose visual of you if you are too far away.",
1866,,*,We're just two meters away!!! What are you talking about?!,
1867,,Nona,Senpai! Help!!!,
1868,,*,"Hey! Stop, slow down before you knock me over---",
1869,,Nona,Senpai! The cart containing the balloons for the anniversary celebration is broken. Now the balloons have all gone!,
1870,,*,Why is that so urgent? I think you still have enough time to prepare some more balloons.,
1871,,Nona,"Well, considering the importance of the anniversary. We used Sivney's inflator...",
1872,,Nona,"Apparently it has some other effects and now the balloons we've lost, have become living creatures...",
1873,,*,That sounds horrible...,
1874,,Nona,A problem also occurred while decorating the haunted house!!!,
1875,,*,What? Do you really think that's appropriate in an anniversary event?,
1876,,Nona,"Well, we adjusted the settings, so it won't be scary anymore!",
1877,,*,"Hmmmm, then it can't be called a haunted house anymore. But why should I care anyways?",
1878,,Nona,"I also told KongMing about this. But she said she's too busy to help, so I came to you.",
1879,,*,But as you can see... I'm not available either. I'm showing the new girls around.,
1880,,Nona,"Hmmmm, is it possible to let them help us out?",
1881,,*,……,
1882,,Frexie,Woah! Are you serious? Count me in!,
1883,,Angelica,I think this will help me get to know the academy way more!,
1884,,,"Oh, lord. Not again.",
1885,,,"If you want to punish me, please find another way.",
1886,,*,What’s that?,
1887,,Nona,You mean the balloons flying in the sky?,
1888,,*,"Well... If you insist on calling them ""balloons"".",
1889,,,If they're meant to be balloons...,
1890,,,They're not meant to pull funny faces...,
1891,,,Or laugh...,
1892,,,And why do they even have teeth?!,
1893,,*,Another nonsensical invention...,
1894,,Nona,"No matter what, the problem we're currently facing are these balloons.",
1895,,*,It sounds more problematic when I have to deal with this...,
1896,,,A beautiful orange balloon smiles. How sweet...,
1897,,,If it can hide its sharp teeth.,
1898,,Orange Balloon,(Rawr~),
1899,,,The purple ones look harmless... Until it noticed me staring and turned black with anger.,
1900,,Purple Balloon,(Rawr!!!!!),
1901,,,"If Sivney can use her talent properly, perhaps the Chaos could’ve been eradicated a long time ago…",
1902,,*,Are these really balloons?! Now they're spitting daggers!,
1903,,Nona,"Senpai, what should we do?",
1904,,*,I don't know.,
1905,,Angelica,Let me handle this.,
1906,,Angelica,It won't matter if I destroy them right?,
1907,,*,"Wow, you sound really reliable right now.",
1908,,Angelica,I've once saw some evil faces in the sky before too...,
1909,,Angelica,Not a fan---,
1910,,,Angelica fires.,
1911,,*,You should give us a warning before you do that.,
1912,,*,But great shot! You even got one of them!,
1913,,Angelica,I've seen this scene once before… it is quite saddening…,
1914,,Angelica,"Even when darkness came, you could still see the light of expression of those who knew what occurred as it was truly blinding.",
1915,,Angelica,Luna…,
1916,,*,The only thing that was blinding was the sudden firing of you arrow.,
1917,,*,Talking so seriously about something nonsensical and still doing something unimaginable…,
1918,,Angelica,Oh... My Luna...,
1919,,*,……,
1920,,,"I don't know how to reply, but...",
1921,,,She looks really sad.,
1922,,,"Anyways, no time to mind Angelica... where's Frexie?!!",
1923,,*,Has anyone seen Frexie?,
1924,,Nona,"Oh, she rushed to the haunted house.",
1925,,*,……,
1926,,,Can we expel Frexie right now?,
1927,,Nono,AHHHHHH!!!,
1928,,Nona,……,
1929,,*,Was that from the haunted house?,
1930,,Nona,"This can't be good, we'd better go take a look.",
1931,,*,I'm coming with you...,
1932,,Nono,"Hey, stay with me!!!",
1933,,*,……,
1934,,Nona,……,
1935,,Angelica,……,
1936,,,"Of course, it's Frexie. She's passed out... Looks like she won't recover anytime soon.",
1937,,,"It might not be nice to say this,",
1938,,,but I have the urge to say it anyways.,
1939,,*,What happened to this stupid idiot?,
1940,,Nono,We mentioned about the surprises we had inside and she rushed in...,
1941,,Nono,"before we could even finish telling her what was exactly inside,",
1942,,*,Surprises...?,
1943,,Angelica,You mean scary surprises?,
1944,,*,She doesn't look like the type of person who's afraid of ghosts.,
1945,,Nona,I thought she would enjoy it and was the reason she rushed inside.,
1946,,Angelica,I thought she might’ve wanted to get some inspiration out of the haunted house since I noticed her notebook filled with joke ideas once.,
1947,,Nona,"So she must have misunderstood... After the adjustment, the facility is no longer scary, but extremely dangerous.",
1948,,*,"To be honest, I don't think she's capable of completing any one of the jokes in her notebook. That's beyond her.",
1949,,*,And... extremely dangerous?,
1950,,Nona,Well... We applied the machines developed by Sivney to set up the surprises. We thought it might come in handy.,
1951,,Nona,But as it turns out. The surprises appeared to be too powerful. It could cause lethal damage to humans.,
1952,,Nona,So the haunted house is now totally not suitable for the anniversary celebration.,
1953,,Nona,"But if someone can provide us enough information, we might still have a chance to fix it...",
1954,,*,...I think you just shouldn't use the tools developed by Sivney.,
1955,,Frexie,"Oh, is it morning already?",
1956,,*,And the idiot awakes---,
1957,,Frexie,I remember I passed out after sensing a strange power!,
1958,,*,You need to find a better excuse next time if you are found in a coma at the front gate of a haunted house.,
1959,,Nona,So what shall we do with the haunted house?,
1960,,*,"I think the best solution is to send down a volunteer to check it out. Frexie, do you want to check it out?",
1961,,Frexie,What?,
1962,,*,Please explore the unknown space for us?,
1963,,Frexie,Do you mean I have to face that again? I don't want to see that ugly clown face again---,
1964,,,So she's not refusing because of danger?,
1965,,,Now I'm starting to wonder how ugly that clown face is.,
1966,,Nona,"Frexie, but I think you should try again... We got the best tricking trap hidden inside!",
1967,,Nona,"If you can check it out and learn how it works, you will be one step closer to be crowned of the queen of jokes!",
1968,,Frexie,"Well, I reckon the clown's face isn't that ugly after all. Here I go!",
1969,,,That was easy. At least we got our lab rat for the test.,
1970,,,I cannot tell how dangerous it is.,
1971,,,But judging from the sound of Frexie screaming...,
1972,,,She did not have a pleasant experience,
1973,,,"And for safety sake, we didn't walk in to check it out.",
1974,,Frexie,Howdy...,
1975,,*,You look pale. Do you need a rest?,
1976,,Frexie,Don't worry. I'm da best......,
1977,,,BAM!,
1978,,*,She passed out and hit the ground again...,
1979,,Nono,We need to send her to the infirmary asap!,
1980,,Raphael,"It's not a big problem. She just passed out because of the shock. Her body wasn't hurt at all. But I thought airheads were tougher, so what did she experience?",
1981,,*,"I hope we won't ever have to know. But thanks to her, Nona finally decided to close the haunted house.",
1982,,*,What a day...,
1983,,Angelica,Yume Academy... This is really a nice place.,
1984,,*,"Oh, Angelica, you're still here?",
1985,,Angelica,"Yes, I'm worried about you.",
1986,,*,Sorry for leaving you halfway...,
1987,,Angelica,Don't worry about it. I did enjoy myself and I'm pretty relieved to know that Luna also lives in such a peaceful place.,
1988,,*,"(I'm really curious about her story with Luna, but it's not the best time to ask her about it...)",
1989,,Angelica,What a nice day...,
1990,,Frexie,￥%……&@……,
1991,,*,"Oh, she's awake?",
1992,,Raphael,"Not really. I gave her a dose of tranquilizer, she needs more rest after staying in a room full of Sivney's invention for such a long time.",
1993,,Frexie,Yume Academy... <@%#...,
1994,,*,What did she say?,
1995,,Raphael,Something like conquer Yume Academy? I'm not so sure.,
1996,,*,……,
1997,,Raphael,"Oh, the party is about to begin.",
1998,,*,You mean the anniversary evening party?,
1999,,Raphael,"Yes, but I'm afraid Frexie won't be able to enjoy that. She's still unconscious.",
2000,,Angelica,Why don't we pour a cup of ice water over her to wake her up?,
2001,,*,"You've got an evil side too, don't you?",
2002,,Raphael,I think she just lacks common sense.,
2003,,*,But I actually feel sorry for Frexie as she cannot catch up to the party.,
2004,,Frexie,"<*!... After taking out Senpai, I'll become number one in Yume Academy!!!",
2005,,Raphael,What's the logic in that?,
2006,,*,……,
2007,,,"Okay, I don't feel sorry anymore.",
2008,,,At least the academy is still peaceful as usual today.,
2009,,,That's good news.,
