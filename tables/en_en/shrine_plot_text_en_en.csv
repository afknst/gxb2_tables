1,Prologue,,Rumors of the Tsuruga Grand Shrine traveled far and wide across the land.,
2,,,"Word goes that a God laid down the foundations for the trial grounds there, and whoever had the skills (or luck) to pass the trials will be rewarded with precious artifacts, crafted by the Gods themselves.",
3,,*,"Every minute of careful planning leads up to this moment! Tsuruga Grand Shrine, be prepared for the greatness that is me!",
4,,,A Shrine Maiden paused sweeping and glared at me.,
5,,Shrine Maiden,"Ugh, outsiders who have no respect for the trials nor for the Shrine, undermining the danger with eyes only on the ultimate prize. Do you mind moving a bit? I'm trying to sweep here.",
6,,*,"Oops, moving now. Though I have to assure you, I am confident that my team and I will pass the fabled trials!",
7,,Shrine Maiden,"I've heard this spoken countless times. Few actually followed through. Anyways, I should be getting back to my duties, so good luck out there.",
8,,*,"Aww, that's so nice of you, Miss. If you are also in the mood to impart wisdom on how to clear the trials, I'd be all ears.",
9,,Shrine Maiden,The only advice I will be giving you today is to go home. You'd at least leave with all your limbs intact.,
10,,*,"Nope, that's not an option. So, since helpful words are out of the picture, maybe some helpful charms and talismans...?",
11,,Shrine Maiden,"Even if there was one, it's bold of you to assume that I'd be handing them out freely. Since you have already made up your mind, then there's nothing I can say or do to help. As I said before, good luck.",
12,,Shrine Maiden,"...If Chizuko was here, she would have tried her best to convince you to leave. But she doesn't understand that bullheaded folks like you just won't change your minds like that...",
13,,*,"Thank you! By the way, who's this Chizuko person you're talking about...?",
14,,Shrine Maiden,"Don't even think about it. Chizuko is kind, adorable, and way out of your league.",
15,,*,She sounds nice and friendly! I will definitely try to befriend her after I pass the trials.,
16,,Shrine Maiden,"Ugh, you're hopeless. Now scram and stop getting in the way.",
17,,*,"See you later! ...Treasure, treasure, here I come~",
18,New Friends?,*,"I'm tired. Exhausted. This patch of ground is nice and comfortable, and I don't want to move.",
19,,Uriel,"Well done, Senpai! We have gathered a bunch of Origami Cranes. This should be enough for a reward from the Pond of Prayers.",
20,,*,"Ooh, a reward! I suddenly feel much more motivated to get up now. Goodbye, comfortable patch of earth.",
21,,,A very familiar Shrine Maiden swept her broom over my feet. Rude.,
22,,Shrine Maiden,"Ugh, you again...is this the ""team"" you mentioned last time?",
23,,Uriel,"Good day, Miss. My name is Uriel.",
24,,*,"I'm so glad to see you again! As you may have guessed, I passed the trials! With all my limbs intact, no less!",
25,,*,"Look, I even got the Origami Cranes to prove it!",
26,,Shrine Maiden,"Hmph, those are authentic ""Symbols of Approval"". I'm surprised that you actually passed the trials. Or did this lady do all the work for you?",
27,,Uriel,"Oh no, I can't take all the credit. Senpai pulled his weight in the trial.",
28,,*,"Hear, hear!",
29,,Shrine Maiden,Good.\nWhy are you standing in the way? The Pond of Prayers is that way.,
30,,*,"My bad, my bad.",
31,,*,"I'm *, by the way. Do you mind telling me your name? I can't always call you ""Miss"", and we're probably going to see each other again.",
32,,Mami,...It's Mami.,
33,,Mami,……,
34,,Mami,...Do you need anything else?,
35,,KongMing,"Senpai, Uriel.",
36,,KongMing,"Instead of clearing the trials and collecting treasure for the Academy like the others, I have a different mission for you. Multiple missions, to be exact.",
37,,Ithil,"*, aside from passing the trials, you will be infiltrating the Shrine, befriending the Shrine Maidens and Priestesses.",
38,,Ithil,"When you have done so, you will try your best to uncover the secrets of the Shrine, especially the source of the treasures.",
39,,KongMing,"The treasures are effective when fighting against Chaos, and any information about them would benefit us greatly.",
40,,KongMing,"Uriel, you are in charge of Senpai's safety. Shady characters have been reported to visit the Shrine, and asking around may draw unwanted attention to Senpai.",
41,,Uriel,I swear on my Shield and my honor as a Knight that I will not allow any harm to befall Senpai.,
42,,*,"Knowledge, maybe? I'd like to learn more about your Shrine.",
43,,*,"The God that this Shrine is dedicated to, the origins of the trials, the history of the treasures, that sort of thing. Since you work here, you must know a lot about this Shrine, right? Please?",
44,,Mami,"Huh, that's new.",
45,,Mami,Most just take the treasure and leave. Not many people want to learn about our Shrine.,
46,,*,"Yes, that's me, always eager to learn! So please? Pretty please? With cherries and ice cream and marshmallows on top?",
47,,Mami,I'm starting to think you are looking for diabetes instead of knowledge.,
48,,*,"Aww, you shouldn't insult my eating habits before you try it yourself. I know this really good cake place...",
49,,Mami,"Thanks, but no thanks.",
50,,Mami,"I'm not an expert in story-telling, so you're barking up the wrong tree if it truly is knowledge that you're seeking.",
51,,Mami,"Visit the Shrine Office at nightfall: Ms. Mizue will be recounting the history of the Shrine, as well as past legends to the younger Shrine Maidens. They wouldn't mind anyone joining them.",
52,,Mami,"However, don't even think about disturbing them, or I will hunt you down personally and murder you with this broom. Are we clear?",
53,,*,"Aww, you wound me with your suspicions.",
54,,Mami,It's always beneficial to be cautious. Who knows what shady businesses you outsiders are up to?,
55,,Mami,"Now, if you will excuse me, I need to get back to sweeping.",
56,,*,...(Puppy eyes),
57,,Mami,...What.,
58,,*,"You mentioned a girl named Chizuko last time, right?",
59,,Mami,？！,
60,,*,"Do you think I can meet her? I mean, a friend of yours is a friend of mine! Right?",
61,,Mami,Get. Out.,
62,Story Night,Uriel,"Senpai, what happened? You were so hyper before, and now you're just…wallowing in misery.",
63,,*,"Nothing big, just a bit miffed that Mami doesn't seem to trust me. Especially after everything we've been through together!",
64,,Uriel,"...You've had a grand total of two conversations with her, Senpai. I think you should give her more time.",
65,,*,"You're right, she must be taken aback by my overflowing friendliness. She probably needs more time to get used to me. Hey, is that the Shrine Office up ahead?",
66,,,Not too far away young Shrine Maidens can be seen sitting on stools and listening attentively to an elderly Priestess.,
67,,Uriel,"Looks like we're just in time. Unfortunately, all seats are taken, so we must stand for the entirety of the session.",
68,,？？？,(Pushes two spare stools forward),
69,,*,"Thank you, dearie.",
70,,？？？,……,
71,,Uriel,She seems like a shy kid.,
72,,*,"Well, yet another mystery to the mix. Let's just listen to what Ms. Mizue has to say first so we can bring some information back to KongMing and Ithil.",
73,,Mizue,"Now, can anyone tell me what did we cover last time?",
74,,？？？,"(Raises hand) You said that the land upon which our Shrine is built used to be wide, fertile plains, and that crops grew without being cultivated!",
75,,Mizue,"Excellent! Well done, Chizuko.",
76,,Chizuko,Hurray!,
77,,*,"(Ah, this must be the Chizuko girl Mami mentioned. She is as adorable as I imagined.)",
78,,Mizue,"Before the Tsuruga Grand Shrine was established, this region was called Sawagi, meaning ""moist and plentiful lands"".",
79,,Mizue,"Sawagi, as Chizuko mentioned, was a wide and fertile terrain. Trees bore fruit overnight, and its habitants never worried about starving.",
80,,Mizue,Everything changed when two monsters arrived.,
81,,Mizue,"They were brothers: the older brother was named Ao Oni, while the younger brother called itself Aka Oni. Ao Oni drew in rain clouds and flooded rivers and lakes when it cried; Aka Oni brought about droughts when it laughed.",
82,,Mizue,"They came from the Tsuyuoka region, where they caused mischief.",
83,,Mizue,"The people of Tsuyuoka had the ability to communicate with Gods. When the brothers were too much to bear with, they plead to the Gods to stop the brothers.",
84,,Mizue,"The Gods heard the prayers. They descended to the mortal world and beheaded the brothers. However, they were no ordinary monsters and could survive even with their heads separated from their bodies.",
85,,Mizue,The brothers fled Tsuyuoka with their heads when the Gods were taken unawares.,
86,,Mizue,"Ao Oni and Aka Oni traveled across the world, suffering from hunger and the cold in search of another place to settle down. When they reached Sawagi, they were bitter about what they have experienced and were jealous of the Sawagi people who lived happy and carefree lives.",
87,,Mizue,"They robbed the people, moving into the most luxurious house in the region, and will only be appeased with annual offerings of treasure, food, and a young girl. Unlike the people of Tsuyuoka, the people of Sawagi couldn't communicate with the Gods, and any efforts to rebel against their oppression were met with a swift and bloody end. They had no choice but to comply with the brothers' requests.",
88,,Mizue,"The two monsters thrived with the yearly offerings. The sacrifice was killed in cold blood, and huge bonfires were raised to burn the body.",
89,,Mizue,"Much to Aka Oni's displeasure, the people of Sawagi didn't fall into poverty as it expected, thanks to the fertile soil of the region.",
90,,Mizue,"It wanted them to suffer as itself and its brother did on the travels, so it started to laugh every day, bringing droughts to the land.",
91,,Mizue,"The soil gradually became barren as Aka Oni's laughs boomed across the land on a daily basis, and crops stopped growing despite the best efforts of the Sawagi people.",
92,,Mizue,"The yearly demands of food became impossible to fulfill, but Aka Oni showed no mercy. It tortured the people when it didn't get what it wanted.",
93,,Mizue,Aka Oni finally achieved its dreams of seeing the inhabitants of Sawagi suffer as it did.,
94,,Mizue,"When all seemed bleak, Enbi no Mikoto, a brave young woman and our savior, decided to stand against Aka Oni and end its ""rule"".",
95,,Mizue,"She wanted Sawagi to return to what it was before the brothers arrived and reasoned that the only way to achieve this was to slay Aka Oni, who brought about all the droughts.",
96,,Mizue,...And that's all for today. You will learn more about Enbi no Mikoto and what she did tomorrow.,
97,,Uriel,"I wonder whether Enbi no Mikoto succeeded in killing the monster. Since she is called ""the Savior"", then she probably did.",
98,,*,"It's likely. Or maybe she failed, but her sacrifice urged the Sawagi people to rebel against the brothers, like a symbol.",
99,,Uriel,I hope not. It's not a befitting ending for someone like her.,
100,,Uriel,"The sun should shine bright in the sky, not dragged down to the depths of the underworld.",
101,,*,Who knows? It's all speculation at this point.,
102,,*,"We should come back tomorrow; I'd like to learn something about the Pond of Prayers, and you can find out what happened to Enbi no Mikoto.",
103,Crossing Paths,Chizuko,(Hums a merry tune),
104,,Uriel,She looks familiar.,
105,,*,"Wait, I think I know who she is...you're Chizuko, right?",
106,,Chizuko,"Oh, yes! But why do you know my name?",
107,,*,"I'm *, and this is Uriel. We were there yesterday at Ms. Mizue's lecture.",
108,,*,"And I've chatted with Mami, who says that you're kind and adorable.",
109,,Chizuko,"Oooh, really?",
110,,Chizuko,"I don't know I should be mortified that she talks about me to total strangers, or be delighted that she does.",
111,,*,"I'd go with delighted. I mean, she surely thinks highly of you.",
112,,*,"I can't say the same for myself though, seeing how she always looks irritated when I'm around.",
113,,Chizuko,"Yes, that sounds like Mami. She's very protective of us, you see. There was an incident where an outsider tried to kidnap a Shrine Maiden for the secrets of our Shrine.",
114,,Chizuko,"Thankfully, Mami chased him out before he succeeded, or we would be in great trouble. She's been wary of outsiders ever since.",
115,,Chizuko,At least she hasn't chased you out with her broom yet. I think that means you're okay in her books.,
116,,*,(But she treats me like dirt...literally. With her sweeping broom.),
117,,Chizuko,"I'm still a Shrine-Maiden-in-training for now, but I want to be like Mami in the future.",
118,,Chizuko,"She is warm, caring, skillful, and just the best big sister anyone can ask for!",
119,,Uriel,"Speaking of this, I'm wondering why the Shrine allowed the rumors to spread.",
120,,Uriel,Wouldn't it be a lot safer for you without having to deal with the Outsiders coming and going every day for the treasure?,
121,,Chizuko,I don't think we can stop the rumors even if we wanted to; everyone must have heard of them by now!,
122,,Chizuko,"Besides, our Senior Priestess said that it is vital to have outsiders participating in the trials instead of just us Shrine Maidens.",
123,,Chizuko,"Seeing how the trials are...you know what, you should join us again tonight. I'm sure Ms. Mizue will cover this in her narration.",
124,,*,Not even a spoiler?,
125,,Chizuko,Nope! You don't see people who are actually interested in the Shrine every day. Most are just here for the trial and the treasure.,
126,,Chizuko,"Us Shrine Maidens are responsible for passing down knowledge and traditions, so that's what I'm doing!",
127,,Uriel,Of course. We still haven't found out whether Enbi no Mikoto managed to defeat the Aka Oni or not.,
128,,Chizuko,"As I said, no spoilers!",
129,,Chizuko,"Enbi no Mikoto is one of the people that I admire a lot, and I like her legend a lot. I can't ruin the experience of hearing her tale for you.",
130,,Chizuko,"Oops, duty calls. See you later~",
131,,*,"Judging from her tone, I think Enbi no Mikoto succeeded, or else she wouldn't be so enthusiastic.",
132,,Uriel,I sure hope so.,
133,,*,It's time for us to head back to the trials anyway; we need to gather more Origami Cranes to exchange treasure with.,
134,,*,"Or should I say ""Symbols of Approval""? That's what Mami called them, right?",
135,,,……,
136,,？？？,"Too much time has passed since I've left. What do they call this place now...Sawagi? No, no, it's Tsuruga, the name of the Shrine.",
137,,？？？,"Too many demons lurk in the shadows, too much pain and despair threaten to consume me wherever I went, so I fled...",
138,,？？？,"But now everything has changed, and the Tsuruga Grand Shrine is only a shadow of its former glory.",
139,,？？？,"If we haven't hesitated that night and sought refuge in the Shrine…we would have changed our fates, wouldn't we?",
140,,Izanami,"I wouldn't have been infected by Chaos, and you would never have left me behind…",
141,,Izanami,"Where are you now, Isanagi?",
142,,Izanami,Have you ever returned to this land that we once called home?,
143,,Uriel,Senpai?,
144,,*,I think I saw someone familiar...but she was gone when I blinked.,
145,,Uriel,Perhaps another student from the Academy? We're not the only ones KongMing and Ithil sent.,
146,,*,"I'm not sure...maybe I'm just imagining things. Anyways, we have a trial to clear. Let's do that.",
147,Story Night…Again,Uriel,"Senpai, Senpai, over here! Ms. Mizue is just about to start!",
148,,*,"Coming! You are really invested in this story now, Uriel.",
149,,Uriel,I'm afraid I won't be able to sleep soundly without knowing the end of this tale.,
150,,Uriel,I wonder if Chizuko made it... I can't find her with everyone wearing the same Shrine Maiden uniforms.,
151,,Mizue,"... Enbi no Mikoto, who decided to rebel against Aka Oni, donned a red dress and hid a sharpened machete among its folds.",
152,,Mizue,She pretended to yield to the two brothers and was taken into their residence as a servant.,
153,,Mizue,"Aka Oni and Ao Oni were satisfied with her service and gradually trusted her with more household chores, granting her access to their private space whenever she saw fit.",
154,,Mizue,"During this time, she read about the origins of the two brothers in their library.",
155,,Mizue,"She also found a painting stuck to a scarecrow that the brothers often beat up in anger. While she didn't understand its significance, she memorized every detail of the painting.",
156,,Mizue,"One night, when Aka Oni was fast asleep, Enbi no Mikoto grasped her trusty machete and entered its quarters.",
157,,Mizue,"In one firm slash, Aka Oni's head was separated from its body.",
158,,Mizue,"Enbi no Mikoto turned to leave immediately but stopped in her tracks as she remembered the scars on the necks of the brothers, as well as the fact that despite being beheaded by the Gods before, they still lived.",
159,,Mizue,"Before leaving the room, she set the scarecrow's head on the decapitated body of Aka Oni, covered it with a thick quilt, and hid Aka Oni's head in the folds of her dress.",
160,,Mizue,"Ao Oni, who was out earlier that night, saw her exit Aka Oni's room. It asked: ""Was your dress always this red?""",
161,,Mizue,"Enbi no Mikoto feigned calmness: ""Yes, I've always worn a red dress.""",
162,,Mizue,Ao Oni didn't notice any evidence of foul play under the dim lights of the night and allowed Enbi no Mikoto to leave with its brother's head.,
163,,Uriel,Yesssss!,
164,,,"Everyone turned to Uriel, who shouted in triumph.",
165,,*,(Whispers) Shush! You're interrupting the story.,
166,,Uriel,I apologize for the disruption.,
167,,Chizuko,(Yells) YESSSSS!,
168,,,"Another yell, this time from Chizuko, drew attention to herself.",
169,,*,"Huh, Chizuko shouted too. At least you're not the only one now.",
170,,Chizuko,Enbi no Mikoto escaped unscathed after slaying the horrendous monster. This is my favorite part of the story!,
171,,Mizue,I know. Your excitement when we arrive at this point of the story sure hasn't dimmed a bit despite how many times you have heard it.,
172,,Mizue,"While it is nice to express your adoration of Enbi no Mikoto verbally, it is stopping me from proceeding with the tale.",
173,,Chizuko,"Whoops. This won't happen again, I promise! I'll shout quietly next time! In my mind!",
174,,Uriel,(Whispers) Me too. This won't happen again.,
175,,Mizue,"... As I was saying, Enbi no Mikoto left the brothers' residence with Aka Oni's head. The people of Sawagi were overjoyed at the announcement that the menace was gone for good.",
176,,Mizue,"Together, they burned Aka Oni's head to ashes, believing that the much-loathed droughts will not harm Sawagi again.",
177,,Mizue,"As Ao Oni didn't share Aka Oni's enthusiasm in torturing the people of Sawagi, they didn't suffer as much with Aka Oni out of the picture.",
178,,Mizue,"Although life in Sawagi was still a far cry from what it was, the people were content with what they managed to achieve.",
179,,Mizue,"During this time, Ao Oni believed that Aka Oni was simply asleep from exhaustion. However, it grew worried when its brother never woke up.",
180,,Mizue,"It flung the quilt off Aka Oni's bed, prepared to ask why Aka Oni was resting for such a long time, but the question died on its tongue as it saw its brother's beheaded body. All that remained in the place of the head was a bunch of hay.",
181,,Mizue,"Ao Oni rushed out of the room. As the brothers were connected by blood, it was able to locate Aka Oni's head with their link. Much to its dismay, it was led to a pile of ashes, indicating Aka Oni's fate.",
182,,Mizue,"While they were immortal, regenerating their bodies will take months, even years.",
183,,Mizue,"Ao Oni sobbed uncontrollably as it realized that it will be parted with its brother for a long, long time.",
184,,Mizue,"Ao Oni's tears drew in heavy rain clouds, and Sawagi suffered from the downpour that ensued.",
185,,Mizue,"The rivers overflowed, submerging the farmlands in floodwaters and robbing them of the ability to grow crops. What's worse, the floodwaters brought about pests and plague as well.",
186,,Mizue,"The Sawagi people, who had just started to settle down again, started to panic, and plead Ao Oni to spare them.",
187,,Mizue,Ao Oni promised to cease the endless rain in exchange for the murderer of its brother.,
188,,Mizue,They did not hesitate to sell Enbi no Mikoto out and delivered her to the hands of Ao Oni to appease it.,
189,,Mizue,... And that's all for today. We'll delve further into the story and into the fate of Enbi no Mikoto tomorrow. I'd be glad to see you join us tomorrow too.,
190,,*,"Thank you, we'd be honored to.",
191,,*,"I can't believe the nerve of these people, turning their backs to Enbi no Mikoto like that. Don't you agree, Uriel... Uriel?",
192,,Uriel,This... this isn't right...,
193,Cranes,Uriel,……,
194,,Chizuko,……,
195,,*,Are you okay? Your eyes are swollen and puffy.,
196,,Chizuko,It's just... I couldn't get the story out of my head and cried myself to sleep last night.,
197,,Uriel,I feel the same.,
198,,*,"I thought you knew what happened to Enbi no Mikoto, Chizuko.",
199,,Chizuko,I do! It's just hard to not be saddened by this part of the story despite having heard it recited countless times…but I probably should pull myself together in front of guests. (Takes several deep breaths),
200,,Chizuko,"... Whew! There, a lot better!",
201,,Chizuko,"So, will the both of you be joining us again tonight?",
202,,Uriel,"Of course! I have faith in Enbi no Mikoto; a strong woman like her wouldn't be stopped by hardships like this one, despite how daunting it seems.",
203,,Chizuko,"Hmm... I'd hate to spoil the experience of hearing this story for the first time,",
204,,Chizuko,"but I can assure you that no, this is not the end of her story.",
205,,Chizuko,I think we will reach the climax of the story today. I can't wait!,
206,,*,That's good to hear. Uriel can finally stop being so nervous and fidgety.,
207,,Uriel,Senpai! (Blushes),
208,,Chizuko,"By the way, where did you come from? I keep forgetting to ask...",
209,,*,"We're from Yume Academy, and I'm her Senpai. Well, I'm the Senpai of almost everyone in the Academy.",
210,,Chizuko,Yume Academy? Is it far away from here?,
211,,Uriel,It's located south of the Wastelands of Foehn.,
212,,Chizuko,The Wastelands of Foehn... I think I read about it before. And you're from further away than that? Wow!,
213,,*,It would have taken us forever to arrive here if the Academy didn't provide us with some high-tech vehicles.,
214,,Chizuko,Oh! Have you seen cranes on your way here? I've never seen one before!,
215,,Uriel,"Cranes? As in, the bird?",
216,,Chizuko,"Yes! In fact, the Tsuruga Grand Shrine is named after the cranes! Well, the word for crane in the local tongue, that is.",
217,,*,"I don't understand... if the shrine is named after them, then shouldn't they be fairly ordinary here?",
218,,Chizuko,"Nope! We don't have cranes here. They are mythical creatures, you see, that only appear when the Gods descend to earth. According to legends, they are servants of God.",
219,,Chizuko,"We've only seen paintings depicting them, but never in real life. Many of us believed that they only exist in stories and tales.",
220,,Chizuko,"It isn't until we heard outsiders talking about them that we knew that they are real, living creatures.",
221,,Uriel,"Well, that's not the case from where we came from. While they aren't too common, some can be found if you're in the right place at the right time. As a matter of fact, I've seen some from afar before.",
222,,Chizuko,Woah! Do they really have black and white feathers with a streak of red on their heads? Do they look as elegant as the ancient scrolls say?,
223,,*,"I've never read your scrolls, so I'm not sure about the elegant part, but yes, that sounds like the cranes I've seen.",
224,,Chizuko,"Just as the scrolls and tomes said! Cranes must have lived in the region before, or our predecessors wouldn't have drawn them this accurately.",
225,,Chizuko,"I hope I can see one myself one day! Did I tell you that one of my dreams is touching the feathers of a crane? I'm named after them, you see, and they're my favorite!",
226,,,"Chizuko was brimming with excitement at learning more about cranes when a passerby crashed into her, causing her to fall to the ground with a yelp.",
227,,？？？,"Tch. Get out of my way, brat.",
228,,Uriel,How rude! Come back here and apologize to Chizuko!,
229,,*,"(I have a bad feeling about that person, but... I should help Chizuko now. This can wait.)",
230,,*,"Are you alright, Chizuko? Here, I'll help you up.",
231,,Chizuko,"Thank you! I'm just taken unawares. Look, not even a scratch!",
232,,Uriel,I memorized what he wore. I can drag him back here so he can apologize properly.,
233,,Chizuko,"Oh no, you don't have to do that! I'm glad that you care, but I think it's partially my fault too; I wasn't paying attention to my surroundings.",
234,,Chizuko,"Besides, he's gone for a while and he was wearing the uniform of his team. I don't think we can catch up to him or single him out from his team.",
235,,？？？,"I heard the commotion. What happened, Chizuko?",
236,,Chizuko,"Senior Priestess Kugatsu! Someone ran into me, and my friends here want them to apologize properly, that's all.",
237,,Senior Priestess,(Shakes head) These outsiders are getting out of line. I'll send them a warning.,
238,,Senior Priestess,And you are?,
239,,*,"Hello! I am *, and this is Uriel.",
240,,Kugatsu,"Good day. I am Kugatsu, Senior Priestess of the Tsuruga Grand Shrine.",
241,,Chizuko,"Senior Priestess, * and Uriel weren't trying to disrupt the order or mean harm to the shrine. I can vouch for them!",
242,,Kugatsu,"Don't worry, I'm not here to harass your friends.",
243,,Kugatsu,"Although if memory serves me right, you are supposed to be helping with preparing the ceremony.",
244,,Chizuko,"Whoops, it's time to get back to work already? I'll start right away, Senior Priestess.",
245,(Yet Another) Story Night,Mizue,"... Enbi no Mikoto was betrayed by the Sawagi people, who handed her over to Ao Oni to appease its anger.",
246,,Mizue,"As Aka Oni's head was burnt to ashes, Ao Oni wanted Enbi no Mikoto to suffer the same fate. It built a large pyre to ensure Enbi no Mikoto will not survive.",
247,,Mizue,"Their foul deed did not change Enbi no Mikoto's devotion of protecting the people, so she walked willingly to the blazing fires.",
248,,Mizue,"As she gazed at the flames, she was reminded of the painting that the brothers seemed to be averse to.",
249,,,"All the other Shrine Maidens, including Chizuko, joined Ms. Mizue in reciting the story.",
250,,Shrine Maidens,Enbi no Mikoto had a revelation regarding the scene on the painting: it was an ancient and primal memory of the ancestors of Sawagi.,
251,,Shrine Maidens,"The painting depicted figures of dancers amid the tendrils of fire. Following their stances, Enbi no Mikoto started to dance as well.",
252,,Shrine Maidens,It was close to impossible to tell that this was her first time going through this routine; the moves were smooth and graceful as she twisted and twirled unscathed in the flames meant to harm her.,
253,,Shrine Maidens,"All of a sudden, the sounds of birds flapping their wings could be heard, and a flock of black, white, and red birds appeared on the horizon.",
254,,Shrine Maidens,"They were cranes, and the flapping of their wings dispersed the rainclouds that Ao Oni summoned.",
255,,Shrine Maidens,"Homura-Ōmikami, the God watching over us all, sat among the cranes and rescued Enbi no Mikoto from the fire.",
256,,Shrine Maidens,"The people of Sawagi raised their heads in wonder, watching the first God to ever descend to the Sawagi lands, cradling Enbi no Mikoto in Their arms.",
257,,Shrine Maidens,The dance of Enbi no Mikoto gradually became the practice we call Kagura dance today.,
258,,Mizue,"Well, it's good to know that you haven't forgotten your heritage.",
259,,*,(Whispers) Just how many times have they heard this story to have it memorized down to every word??,
260,,Mizue,"Ao Oni was beyond frightened when Enbi no Mikoto began to dance, and rushed towards the ignited pyre.",
261,,Mizue,"Much to its astonishment, the flames intending to take Enbi no Mikoto's life stopped its steps, and it couldn't get close to the dancing girl.",
262,,Mizue,"Ao Oni forced itself to shed tears, summoning more rainclouds, but the rain failed to put out the fires.",
263,,Mizue,"It had no choice but to wait for Enbi no Mikoto to finish her dance, sealing its fate by summoning Homura-Ōmikami.",
264,,Mizue,"The battle between Homura-Ōmikami and Ao Oni lasted for seven days and seven nights. While Ao Oni had no power against Homura-Ōmikami, it had regeneration powers and fled whenever it could.",
265,,Mizue,"In the end, Homura-Ōmikami called upon the powers of the sun, and Ao Oni was reduced to ashes.",
266,,Mizue,"Unfortunately, Ao Oni's death didn't restore the ruined lands of Sawagi, where no crops could ever grow again.",
267,,Mizue,The Sawagi people prayed to Homura-Ōmikami to make the earth fertile again for the crops to grow. Enbi no Mikoto prayed as well.,
268,,Mizue,"Moved by Enbi no Mikoto's pleas, Homura-Ōmikami ordered the cranes to fly across Sawagi, bringing life back to the land.",
269,,Mizue,"However, the deeds of the Sawagi people couldn't go unpunished.",
270,,Mizue,"The farmlands of Sawagi never returned to their former fertility, and the people had to work diligently to feed themselves.",
271,,Mizue,"Before Homura-Ōmikami returned to the heavens, They ordered Enbi no Mikoto to build a shrine for Them.",
272,,Mizue,"Enbi no Mikoto named the shrine Tsuruga, after the cranes that were servants of the Deity.",
273,,Mizue,... And this is how the Tsuruga Grand Shrine came into being.,
274,,Uriel,Whew! I'm glad that everything turned out okay for Enbi no Mikoto.,
275,,*,"To be honest, I was expecting to learn more about the trials.",
276,,Uriel,Now that you mention it...,
277,,,Ms. Mizue walked towards us as if she had overheard our conversation.,
278,,Mizue,"Homura-Ōmikami may have defeated Ao Oni, but the brothers were immortal, and the danger still existed.",
279,,Mizue,Come back again tomorrow; the story is far from over yet.,
280,,*,We will.,
281,,,……,
282,,Izanami,"We used to walk under the moonlight, holding hands all the while... but you're not here now, Isanagi.",
283,,Izanami,There was no trace of you ever having returned; why did you stay away? Have you forgotten all about me? About us?,
284,,Izanami,"I will find you, Isanagi... No matter where you have gone.",
285,,Athena,Isanami!,
286,,Izanami,... Athena. This better be important.,
287,,Athena,I have a message from Kratos. She heard that Yume Academy sent students here to the Tsuruga Grand Shrine. Since you're already here...,
288,,Izanami,I am only here to seek Isanagi. This was our homeland; I will not taint the fond memories I have of this place.,
289,,Athena,But Kratos ordered...,
290,,Izanami,Enough. Just tell her what I said. I am not obliged to follow her orders.,
291,,Izanami,"For your safety, I would suggest not taking any rash actions when you're in the Shrine. It is not unguarded.",
292,,Athena,... As you wish. I have another report to make: I discovered traces of Chaos activity here. I suspect it has already infiltrated the shrine.,
293,,Izanami,Chaos!,
294,,Izanami,I understand. If the Chaos have the misfortune of running into me... I will end them.,
295,,Izanami,"... I hear footsteps. We will be getting company soon. If there are no more reports, I will be taking my leave.",
296,,Athena,"That was the last. I wish you well, Izanami.",
297,,*,……？,
298,,Uriel,What will happen next? I hope Enbi no Mikoto lived happily ever after in the end.,
299,,Uriel,... Senpai? Senpai? Have you been listening to anything I said in the last minute?,
300,,*,"I'm sorry, Uriel, but I swear I saw the same person several days ago. I can't seem to remember her identity though.",
