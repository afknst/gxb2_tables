1,The Willful Cat,"Cats are known to be arrogant animals. But to explain the attitude of this bushy-tailed feline is still far-fetched. Psychic first found him in the forest where she took on a fierce battle and was “forced” to give up a large number of servant cookies before she could bring him back to the academy where she named him ""Rumpy"". She had hoped that Rumpy would be able to conform to school life and help train students like the other servants. But soon gave up on the idea when she and Bruno left the Animal Welfare Club with burns and scratches all over their bodies again. ""I can't take it anymore!” The ever-patient Psychic cries out helplessly. Eventually, Rumpy blended in on his own terms - his (seemingly) adorable exterior made students tolerate him, while those who didn’t were quite familiar with his frenzy claws. Despite his occasional troublemaking, he doesn't seem to mind helping out at the school when necessary... that is, if he's in a good mood."
2,Campus Master?,"If we conducted a survey on campus asking, ""Whose life do you envy the most?"", at least 9 out of 10 people’s answers would be ""Rumpy"". Rumpy can be found anywhere on campus, in the trees, on the wall, in the classrooms, on the field, and most of the time, he is just sleeping peacefully. When students are tackling their studies in the classroom or training hard out in the field, it's not hard to imagine the injustice they feel when they see Rumpy sleeping in peace. On rare occasions when Rumpy is awake, he is always moving about the campus, examining everyone he meets and nodding his head in recognition, as if he’s inspecting his own territory... Hey, what's going on? Does he think he owns the campus?"
3,A Hunter's Patience,"One day, after much coaxing and deceiving, Psychic finally convinced Rumpy to undergo a medical check-up. It was supposed to be a routine check-up, but the results came in as a surprise. Although Rumpy's health was fine, his magic powers were extremely weak, and perhaps that was the reason he sleeps so much. Psychic was unable to find out the cause, and her attempts to help Rumpy regain his powers also failed. What caused the loss of his powers? Rumpy might never be able to control fire again, or perhaps there would be a more serious consequence. But looking at his relaxed appearance, it seems he knows nothing about it, or does he not care about that at all? But if you look closely at his eyes as he observes the campus, you will see that they are the eyes of a hunter and he is like a hunter lurking in the woods, waiting patiently for the right moment."
4,Bearing the Title of a Traitor,"Rumpy was born in the dark tunnels, digging hard earth for anything that squirms as food; all the while listening out for the dangers of chaos in his surroundings. They had been living like this for a long time, but the peculiar thing was that Rumpy knew it was not the life they had. They used to roam the woods and play in the streams, worshipping the God of Hunting and Fire. Now, after witnessing his pack devoured by chaos, he realized that if no one could find a way out, it would end up devouring them in the tunnels. Finally, Rumpy chose to leave in search of a peaceful place for his pack to survive. They would surely call him a ""traitor"" for fleeing from the sacred war. But when he left his pack, he was prepared to be deemed a traitor. He had failed many times, but this time, it is his last chance."
5,Reboot,"The deep and dark underground storage rooms of Yume Academy are filled with piles of items abandoned for a variety of reasons stored in its corners, like bad exiled memories in the corners of our brain. During an inventory check of the storage room, a student in the Tech Guild discovered a rusty and tattered robot. It would not have been unusual for such a metal object to be in the storage room, but the student took Robert back to the dormitory and accidentally restarted him, causing quite a disturbance. After a three-hour stern lecture from President Michael, the student revealed that she had received Robert’s signal for help and even give instructions on how to complete the activation. If this is true, it would indicate that Robert was not actually malfunctioning, and what happened was no accident."
6,Evolution,"After his reboot, Robert became the most popular research topic in the Tech Guild. As the research begins, they are surprised to discover that the technology in Robert's body is completely different from that of Yume Academy. As the research continues, more surprising things occur. Robert begins to repair the broken data on his own, and develops it rapidly. A new program appears daily in his memory and it all culminates into a physical manifestation - a machine that can grow. The members of the Tech Guild look on in dismay at the rare sight. This is technology far beyond what they can comprehend, it’s magic. Unfortunately, most of the members of the Tech Guild are from House Monster, where few mastered magic."
7,Sivney's Ambition,"During the War against Chaos, Robert wandered near Yume Forest, where he was found by the United Force. Sivney led the research on Robert and with the discovery of this mysterious technology, sparked her unquenchable passion for new discovery and knowledge. This led to many incomprehensible and powerful inventions, which she eventually abandoned in search of the origin of the mysterious technology and left the academy to begin her quest."
8,The Distant Sky,"""Cold”. That was the first meaningful phrase Robert uttered, ""it’s cold and dark”. But the room was far from cold, and far from dark. In the end, the students in the Tech Guild had no idea whether the temperature and brightness had any effect on Robert.\nThe clouds in the sky were the same shade of white as Robert's exterior. In the age of the gods, there were people who believed in a giant white god floating above the clouds. They called it ""the beluga in the sea of clouds,"" ""the Lord of the Clouds,"" or "" Steel Cloud Eclipse”. Perhaps the reason Robert looked to the sky was that machines have their own gods."
9,An Unexpected Guest,"Most students at Yume Academy can sense the flow of magic, but their abilities vary. One day, an unusual flow of magical energy appeared across campus. As strong as a storm, as turbulent as a current, and leaves purple foggy vortexes in the air that never dissipate. The scarred Sea Serpent then appeared in the center of the vortex. There is no doubt that this winged, elongated creature is a direct link to the magical turbulence. As a result, the school placed it under strict protection and management."
10,The Unsolved Mystery,"Even in Yume Academy, the Sea Serpent is a peculiar creature. After confirming her friendliness and harmlessness, the academy began a study of her ecology. Food doesn't seem to be a necessity for the Sea Serpent, although she happily devours Psychic's servant cookies, it could just be out of curiosity. On the other hand, the Sea Serpent showed remarkable ability in manipulating magic, which may have triggered the magical turbulence at the time. But how did she appear on campus out of nowhere? The most important question is left yet unanswered."
11,Sea Serpent,"The name ""Sea Serpent"" comes from an ancient book, The Nature of Life - The Basic Summoning by Eggret. In the past, mages used these secretive, quick and nimble magic skilled creatures to communicate with each other in magical sequences that only mages could decipher. With their advanced means of communication and unparalleled abilities, mages were able to establish an organization that was hidden and above the state, influencing factors around the world. Later, science-based communication technologies developed, giving even mortals the ability to transmit words across great distances - a power that had previously been akin to magic. It shook the social hierarchy mages. But this did not turn into a direct conflict, for soon enough the wave of Chaos took both worlds by storm."
12,A Late Reply,"The book describes a summoning ritual for a creature called the ""Sea Serpent,"" a creature with which mages can enter into a contract to provide magical power in exchange for their loyalty. Strangely enough, however, there is no ritual to undo the summoning or breach the contract in the book. Usually, a summoned beast cannot exist independently from its summoner. However, this ""Sea Serpent"" travelled a long way to campus. Perhaps she holds magical powers of her own, or maybe someone is still providing her with magical powers, waiting for her to deliver and return with a message that no one can now decipher."
