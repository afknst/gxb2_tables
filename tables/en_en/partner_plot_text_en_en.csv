3,,,Gambler would draw the most critical card at the direst moments...... and reverse the odds stacked against her.,
4,,,Victory... power... business deals... Much was in her hand. This world has given Gambler everything. She became the Empress of the gambling world.,
5,,,Like every other day. The card club has a new challenger. \n This challenger will be just another stepping stone on Gambler's path to domination.,
6,,Gambler,My turn... a pair.,

13,,Saint,Let's see you deal with this.,

16,,Saint,You fight with honor...,
17,,Saint,Are you interested in following me?  \n There are so many guilds I need to take out. I honestly will have more work than I could deal with...,

19,,Saint,Hahaha… You can say that.,
20,,,"Just not long ago, Yume Academy was a place of conflict.",

30,,Michael,How dare you say that!,
31,,Michael,"If you keep doing this, then you will become no different than those other guilds. You may be just another Succuba!!",
32,,Saint,How dare you!!!,
33,,Joan,"I mean, Saint...",
34,,Joan,The committee usually wouldn't make such a generous offer... Succuba's guild won't give such an opportunity.,

53,,Saint,"All set? Don't make me say this again. What do we have, Gambler?",
54,,Gambler,More than 30% of Academy's underground trade of fried noodle bread happens in this market.,
55,,Gambler,Every move on the campus is leaked by the meal delivery network. And Succuba's guild has all of it under their control.,

57,,Committee Members,"Yes, ma'am!",
58,,Joan,"Wait a minute, Saint! We should wait for Michael's signal.",

72,,Michael,"....Well, Saint, it's you who planned the assault and the rules of engagement.",
73,,Michael,Your recklessness will endanger your team!,

83,,Succuba,You've got something in you finding me here. But what can you do now?,
84,,Succuba,"Besides, you're not the first discipline committee member who found me.",

97,,,"In a fit of rage, Saint turned into a different person.",
98,,,Not only the Committee Members but also even Gambler trembled in fear.,
99,,,"After that day, Saint kept to herself for a long time…",
100,,Saint,What's the status?,
101,,Gambler,"Saint, we've tracked down and seized almost everything on the list.",

103,,Saint,What else?,
104,,Gambler,... We've found... the girl.,
105,,Gambler,Serious dehydration and malnutrition! Not to mention a severely damaged immune system.,
106,,Gambler,She must have been abused and imprisoned for a long time.,
107,,Saint,If we were only quicker...,
108,,Gambler,It was the best we could do. We couldn't have done it without you...,
109,,Saint,Shh...,

127,,Gambler,Girls! Get ready to retreat!,
128,,,Battle was over in a blink of an eye.,

148,,Joan,"Saint, wait!",
149,,Gambler,"Joan, just give it a rest.",
150,,Joan,But we still need to register those infected girls and inspect their bodies. It's a direct order from the club president.,
151,,Saint,huh… hehe… HEHEHEHEHE,
152,,Joan,"Saint, why are you laughing?",
153,,Saint,(Exhausted) WHY AM I LAUGHING?!,
154,,Saint,I thought Michael was the only fool. I never thought another one would be standing right in front of me.,
155,,Saint,"The ""Chaos Figure"" outbreak... and its infection.... are highly contagious... Their names… personality… blood type… it doesn't matter what they have...",
156,,Saint,But where they've been... Their relationships... Their classes... Dorm or even their common hangouts… That's the key to the mystery…,
157,,Joan,Agreed...,
158,,Saint,（Exchausted) You guys keep looking... I... have something else to do...,

779,,KongMing,The loading and reaction system of the prosthetic limb is usually designed according to a student's physical intensity.,
780,,KongMing,"But every time Iron Fist's body declines, her traumatic responses worsens.",
781,,KongMing,We'll need Iron Fist's mental signal to stabilize...,
782,,KongMing,So that your body and prosthetic limb could recognize each other.,
783,,,"Now it's the third week of ""Group Therapy""",
784,,,KongMing has been silent for a long time after today's inspection.,
785,,KongMing,...Yesterday's reading... and the day before yesterday... is less than 0.13%?,
786,,KongMing,It's stabilized...,
787,,Iron Fist,Senpai?,
788,,KongMing,The reading's fluctuation is within the safety zone. It has stabilized! Finally...,
789,,KongMing,Iron Fist. You're ready!,
790,,KongMing,"Maybe the day after tomorrow... No, tomorrow. We will be able to operate the transplant surgery tomorrow!",
791,,KongMing,(Ponders deeply) There's a lot to do. Including making adjustments to your prosthetic limb MKII...,
792,,Iron Fist,Senpai...,
793,,,"The alarm went off gently ""Beep... Beep..."".",
794,,KongMing,(Surprised) Wait... again...?,
795,,KongMing,Iron... Fist...,
796,,Iron Fist,...,
797,,KongMing,"Oh, Iron Fist... I'm... one of those people who devote entirely to their work.",
798,,KongMing,"But for me, Iron Fist is more than just ""work"".",
799,,Iron Fist,Am I...?,
800,,KongMing,You're also my important friend...,
801,,KongMing,I've got so many things that we can do together.,
802,,KongMing,"Student Union, Cafeteria, Book Club or many other places on campus... It doesn't matter...",
803,,KongMing,I want Iron Fist to be able to walk freely and get to see them all.,
804,,Iron Fist,Senpai...,
805,,KongMing,That's why I can't achieve this without your help.,
806,,KongMing,"So let's work together, Iron Fist?",
807,,Iron Fist,...Okay!,
808,,Raphael,The second transplant surgery...,
809,,Raphael,Inject the anesthetic. Keep an eye on the vital signs! Get ready for the operation...,
810,,Raphael,Everyone! We're starting now!,
811,,KongMing,Iron Fist. Remember what we talked about... Do your best.,
812,,Iron Fist,...Yes.,
813,After Waking Up,,After having... A long long dream.,
814,,,"A person talked to me. She told me to be braver. I know her. Yet, I couldn't figure out her name.",
815,,,"She moved farther and farther away from me. I tried to catch up, but I... It wasn't me.",

817,,Iron Fist,Raphael...,
818,,Iron Fist,KongMing Senpai... Ouch...!,
819,,KongMing,I'm here.,
820,,KongMing,"Currently, your body is getting used to the new nerves. If you sense some acute pain, it's should be normal.",
821,,Iron Fist,Ouch... I'm okay...,
822,,Iron Fist,"It feels... strange... As if it's phantom pain, but... But it doesn't hurt, Ouch...",
823,,Iron Fist,"As if, Ah... As if there's something...",
824,,KongMing,Looks like you're in good shape...,
825,,KongMing,"If you can feel it, maybe you can try and move it?",
826,,Iron Fist,"Hmmm... I still can't feel a thing, is it...",
827,,Iron Fist,…………？？？,
828,Rehabilitation Training,KongMing,"(Battle) Warning, the next wave comes from the left, left, right!",
829,,Iron Fist,(Battle) Blocked it!,
830,,,"Three days after the surgery, Iron Fist started special training.",
831,,,It's so Iron Fist can get used to the new arm. And the new arm also needs to get used to Iron Fist.,
832,,,The training drills use dummies as a target. It also uses both KongMing and Raphael as a target.,
833,,,Training is becoming more intense and frequent.,
834,,,...from assisting a patient to adapt and recover to the point that is tough even to most students——,
835,,,And Iron Fist... Made it.,
836,,,"Attack... Defend... And tactical maneuvers... During each training,",
837,,,The hope and cheers from KongMing's eyes give Iron Fist the strength to carry on.,
838,,,"With the daily training, Iron Fist recovers both physically and mentally.",
839,,,But doubt emerges and grows gradually in Iron Fist's mind...,
840,,Iron Fist,Why...? Why is training becoming more frequent...,
841,,Iron Fist,Senpai is getting more and more irritable... Has she lost her patience?,
842,,Iron Fist,"Maybe, after I finish training. She is going to... Leave",
843,,Iron Fist,...Leave me?,
844,Final Training! Farewell,,Though every time Iron Fist tells herself she's going to be okay.,
845,,,"Once the doubts are planted in her mind, they will gradually take root and be difficult to remove.",
846,,,It's the last day of training. Iron Fist kept telling herself to get ready for the truth...,
847,,,KongMing won't be with you forever.,
848,,KongMing,(Fighting) Watch your balance! Keep up the pace! It's coming!,
849,,Iron Fist,(Fighting) Got it! I got it!,
850,,KongMing,Well done!!,
851,,KongMing,Both you and the prosthetic limb!!,
852,,Iron Fist,Thank you...,
853,,KongMing,"As you can see, Iron fist?",
854,,KongMing,You're improving with your prosthetic limb.,
855,,Iron Fist,That's what it looks like...,
856,,KongMing,According to your physical status...,
857,,KongMing,...the real power of the arm was locked during your surgery.,
858,,KongMing,"From now on, the power of your prosthetic limb will keep rising with your physical and mental strength.",
859,,Iron Fist,"Thank you, Senpai! For all that effort..!.",
860,,KongMing,"Haha, don't worry about it~!",
861,,Iron Fist,"Now, it is training... Over?",
862,,KongMing,Yes.,
863,,Iron Fist,So now...,
864,,Iron Fist,...Is it time... To say goodbye?,
865,,KongMing,"Yes, exactly.",
866,,KongMing,"Regardless, both your arm's performance and recovery went smoothly.",
867,,KongMing,There's no reason for me to stay here.,

869,,KongMing,Neither do you. Iron Fist~,
870,,Iron Fist,(Wanting to Cry)..........,
871,,Iron Fist,What?,
872,,KongMing,Iron Fist. You've already recovered. You are already healthier than most of the students here.,
873,,KongMing,You can't stay in the ward anymore.,
874,,Iron Fist,(Bashful) Oh...,
875,,KongMing,"There's one more bed in my dorm that's empty, and I don't mind having a roommate...",
876,,KongMing,Iron Fist... I hope you won't say no?,
877,,Iron Fist,(Bashful) No... No... I won't!,
878,,KongMing,Welcome to my room~!,

886,,KongMing,Yes.,
887,,Iron Fist,I packed you some dinner from Sonya. Do you want it...?,
888,,KongMing,Just eat it yourself! I'm just back for some data. I'm heading to the Student Union.,
889,,Iron Fist,Do you really not want to eat it? Just let me pack you some of these. I'll send it to the Student Union if it's too late...,
890,,KongMing,(Fidgety)...,
891,,Iron Fist,(Puppy Dog Look)?,
892,,KongMing,Then I'll eat with you before I leave...,
893,,,KongMing only had a few bites. Then she left with the packed meal in a hurry.,
894,,,"Since then, KongMing spent a lot of time on campus and with the Student Union. And came back to her dorm occasionally.",
895,,,"Until one day, KongMing never returned.",
896,,,"After hearing from the messenger of the Student Union, Iron Fist sits for a long time reflecting.",

1122,,Saint,Once onshore. We pray no more... It's like that with everyone…,
1123,,Gabriel,"Hmm, Saint…",
1124,,Saint,My bad. I wasn't sure what to say... Old habits die hard.,
1125,,Saint,"So let's start. What do you want to know, Gabriel?",
1126,,Gabriel,To get to the bottom of this. What made you and the Discipline Committee go different ways?,
1127,,Saint,It's because they tell lies! They hide too much truth and facts. They keep everyone in the dark!,
1128,,Gabriel,But you're the one who gave the speech at the Welcome Ceremony. You must know the history pretty well yourself.,
1129,,Gabriel,You must know something... Something that we don't know about.,
1130,,Saint,"Yes, it's about the origin of the campus, the hidden threat, and Chaos…",
1131,,Saint,I do know. But... is it really true?,
1132,,Saint,Don't you feel like there is something wrong with the campus?,
1133,,Gabriel,This I can't say…,
1134,,Saint,"But you do have this feeling, don't you?",
1135,,Saint,"That simple fact is you don't remember your past. Do you, Gabriel?",
1136,,Saint,Nope. Nobody does. Unless you were infected by the CHAOS FIGURE…,
1137,,Gabriel,Hmmm... Yeah. Well…,
1138,,Saint,...You hesitated. Do you feel guilty about something?,
1139,,Saint,Is it because of your memory?!,
1140,,Gabriel,Hey! Don't say reckless stuff like that~! I don't do this kind of thing with Discipline Members.,
1141,,Saint,"Looks like even you have some secrets, Gabriel…",
1142,,Saint,Then cut the crap. What were we talking about again?,
1143,,Gabriel,CHAOS FIGURE,
1144,,Saint,"Yes, CHAOS FIGURE.",
1145,,Saint,"As we all know the infected will go into a rage, lose their minds, and turn destructive…",
1146,,Saint,"...But they also obtain completely new, horrible, and devastating powers.",
1147,,Gabriel,...Wow.,
1148,,Saint,But there is a chance--- A chance yet to be precisely calculated.,
1149,,Saint,"The chance is that--- If you overcome the infection, you will start to remember...",
1150,,Saint,"Your past memories will appear like chips and fragments, piece by piece.",
1151,,Saint,Then you will be on your own if you put them together…,
1152,,Gabriel,"Let me ask you a question, Saint.",
1153,,Gabriel,What about your memory?,
1154,,Gabriel,"Your infection. Going on a rampage, deserting... \n and... joining Def.....",
1155,,Gabriel,"Everyone know these stories... Then according to your theory,",
1156,,Gabriel,You must have your memory back. What is that like?,
1157,,Gabriel,"Saint, who are you?",
1158,,Saint,"Rampage... It is the final official announcement, right?",
1159,,Saint,No.,
1160,,Gabriel,What?,
1161,,Saint,"There's no link between my memory and this issue, and I don't want to talk about it.",
1162,,Saint,What I want to say is that... It is always good to have your memory back... No matter how it is done... Or at least it is better than knowing nothing.,
1163,,Saint,"So, why don't we just put aside the stories which we once believed...",
1164,,Saint,"And for now, just think in a different train of thought and assume that---",
1165,,Gabriel,That's something very incendiary...,
1166,,Saint,Just tell me if I'm wrong.,
1167,,Saint,What if everything is actually the opposite of what we thought?,
1168,,Saint,"The campus is a menace, a prison, it's a kind of lie.",
1169,,Saint,"And CHAOS FIGURE, is the cure that would free us.",
1170,,Gabriel,But...,
1171,,Saint,I know what you want to say. They must be patients that haven't fully recovered.,
1172,,Saint,But there's also poison in the drug... Maybe that's just a side effect?,
1173,,Saint,Or the drug isn't 100% effective... But at least...,
1174,,Gabriel,That's a sinister tone...,
1175,,Gabriel,"Saint, you're playing with fire.",
1176,,Saint,Playing with fire?,
1177,,Saint,"I've experienced everything, and I even joined DEF...",
1178,,Saint,...I... AM THE FLAME!,
1179,Morning Interview (Part Two),Gabriel,"...Let's continue the interview. I'm Gabriel from the News Agency, and I'm interviewing Saint from Def.",
1180,,Gabriel,"So, Saint. You think it's the Elites, including the Discipline Committee and the Student Union...",
1181,,Gabriel,Are you lying to us?,
1182,,Saint,The Elites...? Hmm.,
1183,,Saint,I'm afraid they are just lying to themselves. They're just like the rest of us.,
1184,,Saint,We're all just puppets pulled by strings.,
1185,,Gabriel,Then who is pulling the strings? Who else could stand for the Academy?,
1186,,Saint,Do you know about magic tricks?,
1187,,Saint,"When you watch a magic trick, don't stare at the magician's eyes, and listen to whatever he says.",
1188,,Saint,You need to pay attention to his hands and sleeves...,
1189,,Saint,"Who, is always with the academy? And was independent of all the organizations,",
1190,,Saint,"The one who is detached, unpredictable, and always guiding us all?",
1191,,Gabriel,Senpai?,
1192,,Saint,I'm afraid so. He's the one who has the deepest links within the campus.,
1193,,Saint,"To find the truth of the Academy, he is the key.",
1194,,Gabriel,"Then, what about Nobunaga's recent assault on Senpai. Was that authorized by Def?",
1195,,Gabriel,"""Senpai is the source of Chaos"", this rumor is going around now.",
1196,,Saint,Then... Do you believe it?,
1197,,Gabriel,Me...?  Hmm... Ahahaha...,
1198,,Saint,Hahaha... Ouch---,
1199,,Gabriel,What's wrong?,
1200,,Saint,Nothing just got jumped by someone. The scar is still there---,
1201,,Gabriel,An ambush? Who did that to you?,
1202,,Saint,"Can't tell, they were dressed like DEF agents, and their faces were masked...",
1203,,Gabriel,So...,
1204,,Saint,...It can be anyone.,
1205,,Saint,"But no matter who it is, my actions seem to be a thorn in someone's body.",
1206,,Saint,"By the way, don't tell anyone about this for now.",
1207,,,Some noise heard from afar. Looks like there's an argument in the Cafeteria---,
1208,,Sonya,It's a neutral zone here!,
1209,,Discipline Committee Member,Discipline Committee here for a case---,
1210,,Discipline Committee Member,"Do not resist, Sonya.",
1211,,Sonya,"You guys can come in, but don't start any trouble. If you want to fight, fight outside~",
1212,,Gabriel,"Ahh, just as I predicted---",
1213,,Gabriel,Runs really fast…,
1214,,Gabriel,Ah! Did she at least pay for the meal?,
1215,,Gabriel,"Good afternoon, Senpai~!",
1216,,Michael,"Someone saw Saint was here, and she sat right there.",
1217,,Gabriel,"Yes, she just left. Too fast to stop her~",
1218,,Michael,……,
1219,,Gabriel,I was interviewing Michael~,
1220,,,"""...Let's continue I'm Gabriel from the News Agency, and I'm interviewing Def's front-line…""",
1221,,Gabriel,See~ I've got immunity during the interview~,
1222,,Michael,"You were interviewing? Okay, I'll let this one slide.",
1223,,Gabriel,Senpai?,
1224,,Michael,"Here, 10 P.M tonight.",
1225,,Gabriel,Can I refuse your offer?,
1226,,Michael,Try me.,
1227,,Michael,Your immunity won't work when it's us...,
1228,,Michael,The case ends. Let's go---,
1229,,Discipline Committee Member,Yes ma'am!,
1230,Night talk,Michael,……,
1231,,Gabriel,"Yeah, I know I'm late.",
1232,,Gabriel,It took me some time to sneak around the patrol.,
1233,,Gabriel,"But Senpai, you also disobeyed the curfew regulated by Discipline Committee and Student Union.",
1234,,Gabriel,Can we call this a secret unlawful assembly?,
1235,,Michael,Thought you don't mind this kind of thing.,
1236,,Gabriel,You must have misunderstood me. Senpai~,
1237,,Gabriel,I could most definitely obey the rules if it works for me!,
1238,,Michael,……,
1239,,Gabriel,"Hmm, okay... Now to business.",
1240,,Michael,"Discipline Committee, Student Union, and Infirmary are now taking measures against the CHAOS FIGURE.",
1241,,Michael,"By using campus security, containment, and isolation, all these approaches were proven to be very effective.",
1242,,Michael,"And night patrol is also involved in this, you should know exactly, how this works...",
1243,,Gabriel,Senpai,
1244,,Gabriel,Sonya's not here. There's only you and me now.,
1245,,Gabriel,"You arranged such an ""interview"", just to chitchat?",
1246,,Michael,……,
1247,,Michael,Do you know what the Academy's goal is?,
1248,,Gabriel,To fight Chaos... I've read the log.,
1249,,Michael,Yume always fights at the front line of the war. To protect the world from the invasion of Chaos.,
1250,,Gabriel,But why is this not recorded in the Academy?,
1251,,Michael,"...The last generation of Yume, has already defeated the Chaos.",
1252,,Gabriel,There's a previous generation??,
1253,,Michael,"After the victory, this Academy was built to train the next generation of Yume.",
1254,,Michael,"But now, CHAOS FIGURE is here...",
1255,,Michael,(Distressed) Is the defense line breached? Or the Chaos found a new way to invade?,
1256,,Michael,I don't know either...,
1257,,Michael,"So now, I can only trust Senpai.",
1258,,Michael,"When the time comes, he will bring us the right answer...",
1259,,Gabriel,"Senpai, so... The previous generation... Where are they now.",
1260,,Michael,(Distressed)...,
1261,,Gabriel,"Even for you, it is still a mystery...",
1262,,Gabriel,"Senpai, do you know about ""The Seven Mysteries of the Academy""?",
1263,,Michael,The rumors such as Sonya's set meal or Bud Elf's flower?...,
1264,,Gabriel,"No, I mean... ""The Seventh Mystery""",
1265,,Michael,Enough!,
1266,,Gabriel,！？,
1267,,Michael,Don't mention that again!,
1268,,Michael,Understand!?,
1269,,Gabriel,I have the reporter immunity......,
1270,,Michael,(grave concern)...,
1271,,Gabriel,I got it ....,
1272,Recruitment,,"The cold wind passing through Gabriel's ear, reminding her of that interview from before.",
1273,,Gabriel,"Senpai, why are you telling me all this?",
1274,,Michael,Because I need your help.,
1275,,Michael,As an agency with high mobility and great combat ability,
1276,,Michael,News Agency. No... The night patrol is always a major force that maintains peace on campus.,
1277,,Gabriel,... Thanks for the compliment.,
1278,,Michael,I can hear it... Even smell it... A great crisis is coming to the Academy...,
1279,,Michael,The danger is coming from both inside and outside...,
1280,,Michael,"But the CHAOS FIGURE, and the masked men's assault. We can't handle them all.",
1281,,Michael,"With the help of Patrol, there is nothing that can sneak pass our eyes!",
1282,,Michael,Gabriel. What do you say?,
1283,,Gabriel,I...,
1284,,Gabriel,What should I do... I almost got a headache...,
1285,,Gabriel,Why is this happening right now...,
1286,,Saint,"Gabriel, what do you say?",
1287,,Gabriel,"Well, if the News Agency gets involved in dominating the campus, that's just...",
1288,,Saint,Say no more. I got you... So how about this?,
1289,,Saint,DEF is now searching for the link between CHAOS FIGURE and the Academy...,
1290,,Saint,I can tell you the latest internal information...,
1291,,Saint,"About the Academy, CHAOS FIGURE, even DEF...",
1292,,Saint,You can exchange them with your info. How's that?,
1293,,Gabriel,Not to recruit but to form an alliance?,
1294,,Gabriel,Saint. You've really got something in you.,
1295,,Saint,So that we can both get something from this....,
1296,,Gabriel,Hmmm...,
1297,,Saint,Don't need to answer right now. Just think it over!,
1298,,Saint,Huh? What's the argument about over there?,
1299,,Gabriel,Everyone is gathering their forces...,
1300,,Gabriel,"Even if it's to improve the odds of victory. But, they're all gathering at the same time...?",
1301,,Gabriel,Does that mean the real war is coming?,
1302,Night Patrol,Gabriel,I'm back...,
1303,,Veila,You've had a long day. Gabriel~!,
1304,,Veila,Did the interview go smoothly? Can we get it published tomorrow?,
1305,,Gabriel,Don't bring it up.....,
1306,,Gabriel,"(The messages they gave are not to be released. Well played, You two...)",
1307,,Gabriel,(They knew I will keep it a secret so they just told me everything. Hmmph~),
1308,,Gabriel,Listen to me...,
1309,,Veila,Who is that?,
1310,,DEF Agent,Surround this place. They can't run!,
1311,,Gabriel,"Finally, it's coming...",
1312,,Gabriel,"(Wiping out the unstable factors? So, there's really something that is going to happen...)",
1313,,Gabriel,"News Agency--- No, the Patrol. Intercept them!",
1314,,Gabriel,Spread out and evacuate to the backup base!,
1315,,News Agency Members,Copy!!,
1316,,,No one fights better at night than the Patrol.,
1317,,,"Before the raiders even noticed, all the members successfully evacuated.",
1318,,,"Their new base and operations will be more secretive, effective, and unpredictable.",
1319,,,"No more counter-attacks,",
1320,,,"Now, it is time for the Patrol to take real action.",
1321,,Gabriel,A huge crisis is about to break out...,
1322,,Gabriel,"""Judgment Day""... Do we still stand a chance to survive?",
1323,On That Day,,"On that day, Yume Academy was in chaos.",
1324,,,After the CHAOS FIGURES outbreak.,
1325,,,A great disturbance happened at the School Festival. Then…,
1326,,,"A new underground association, D.E.F, assaulted the HQ of Discipline Committee amidst the chaos.",
1327,,,"Discipline Committee, Student Union, every clubs... the Academy's whole operation freezes.",
1328,,,Even worse...,
1329,,,...Senpai was missing.,
1330,,,Was Senpai the source of the Chaos?,
1331,,,"In order to find the source of the Chaos, did Senpai have to enter the Academy's forbidden areas?",
1332,,,Was Senpai truly a mystery?,
1333,,,Whatever the truth was... it doesn't matter anymore.,
1334,,,"After Senpai's absence, everyone in Yume Academy seems to no longer trust each other.",
1335,,,Just as if their bonds were cut off.,
1336,,,"Officers of Student Union, Discipline Member, D. E. F member, and Club Elites... are no longer important.",
1337,,,"They have been ambushed, surrounded, infected, or fled",
1338,,,"No matter which side they picked, it doesn't matter to the infected.",
1339,,Aquaris,(Gasp)... Can't do this anymore…,
1340,,Aquaris,Here... it should be here…,
1341,,Aquaris,Give it a rest... (Deep breathe)…,
1342,,,……,
1343,,Aquaris,"Well, Sonya's Cafeteria is not far away... Keep fighting Aquaris!",
1344,,Aquaris,Huh?,
1345,,,(Sound of fighting heard from a distance. It sounds like...),
1346,,Aquaris,"Iron Fist, let me help you!",
1347,,Iron Fist,"Wonderful, Aquaris!",
1348,,Iron Fist,"Looks like we'll need to stick together again, Aquaris.",
1349,,Aquaris,"Iron Fist, what's your plan?",
1350,,Iron Fist,"Find survivors and move together! The more teammates we have, the bigger the chance we'll make it…",
1351,,Aquaris,In finding Senpai!,
1352,,Iron Fist,"Yes, in finding senpai, and... KongMing senpai…",
1353,,Aquaris,"Senpai, just wait a minute. It will be quick…",
1354,,Aquaris,"Alright, let's go! Senpai!",
1355,,Iron Fist,Okay…,
1356,,,"So, Aquaris and Iron Fist searched for survivors on their way scouting to the edge of Academy.",
1357,,,"The farther they move forward, the more survivors they've rescued. The group gradually becomes slower and slower.",
1358,,,"Finally, they got surrounded by the infected…",
1359,,Iron Fist,"Watch out! There are some more... ""things"" coming!",
1360,,Aquaris,There's literally no end to them…,
1361,,*,"Iron Fist, Aquaris and everyone!",
1362,,*,Thank Goodness! Everybody is fine!,
1363,,Iron Fist & Aquaris,Senpai???,
1364,Before Strike Back,,Senpai is back!,
1365,,,"Students built up a strong line of defense in front of the radio station, and even Discipline Committee and D.E.F had also joined us.",
1366,,,"While sending out squads to search and rescue survivors in Academy, we've also gather forces.",
1367,,,A strike back is at hand…,
1368,,Michael,"Gabriel, how do we look?",
1369,,Gabriel,We've made contact with Dracula. House Ghost is still in control. But…,
1370,,Gabriel,House Human has already fallen and is controlled by Chaos Legion. And the one in command…,
1371,,Gabriel,...It's Guan Yin.,
1372,,Joan & Saint,！？,
1373,,*,"So, even Guan Yin is infected…",
1374,,Gabriel,"According to Michael's evaluation, Guan Yin is deeply infected,",
1375,,Gabriel,"With CHAOS FIGURE intensifying her strength, she's already…",
1376,,Lucifer,Now she is standing between us and House Human.,
1377,,Lucifer,"We'll need to consider, how to…",
1378,,Michael,Lucifer! You need to think about the feeling of others above all else…,
1379,,Joan,"Please don't worry about me, President.",
1380,,Joan,"We've faced so many of the infected. If Guan Yin's infection is irreversible, then…",
1381,,Saint,Hey! We are talking about Guan Yin!!!,
1382,,Joan,"If you cannot accept reality, then I'll do that!!",
1383,,Joan,Guan Yin is deeply infected! And there is no going back!,
1384,,Joan,If she is hostile... She will become a great threat... Both to us or the counterattack operation!,
1385,,Joan,We must take her out!!!,
1386,,*,……,
1387,,*,What if... We have other alternatives...?,
1388,,Michael,……,
1389,,Gabriel,……,
1390,,Saint,...Tch.,
1391,,Aquaris,"Senpai, and president Michael, I…",
1392,,Michael,？,
1393,,Aquaris,I... volunteer... to fight against House Human…,
1394,,Michael,"Aquaris, think before you act. We need to think of a plan...",
1395,,Aquaris,I've been thinking about this for a long time and... I'd like to lead the front line in this mission.,
1396,,Joan,"Aquaris, you helped suppressed the infected once before.",
1397,,Aquaris,"Yes. Not long after I join the Discipline Committee, the CHAOS FIGURE appeared.",
1398,,Joan,"I still remember that operation. All your teammates returned safely, but you didn't…",
1399,,Aquaris,"Yes, I... I was lost, and then…",
1400,,Joan,Then what?,
1401,,Aquaris,I fell behind…,
1402,,Joan,And what was your score in field combat training?,
1403,,Aquaris,B-,
1404,,Joan,Should I continue? Or…,
1405,,Michael,"Joan, that's enough.",
1406,,Joan,President.,
1407,,Aquaris,……,
1408,,Michael,"Aquaris, you've done very well,",
1409,,Michael,"You and Iron Fist helped Senpai gather survivors. And everyone owes you that, you've done well enough.",
1410,,Michael,But House Human... That will be a tough battle.,
1411,,Michael,And... Winning is not guaranteed…,
1412,,Michael,"So in this case, I think... I will leave the job to someone who is more capable to do it, okay?",
1413,,Aquaris,OK…,
1414,I must be there,,"That night, Aquaris snuck out of camp without being noticed.",
1415,,,"But as soon as she realized it, she isn't alone...",
1416,,Aquaris,Ah... I got lost again.,
1417,,Aquaris,So where am I now…,
1418,,？,"Aquaris, where are you going?",
1419,,Aquaris,How could it be…,
1420,,Aquaris,Why are you here?,
1421,,Iron Fist,There should be someone with you... Aquaris... In case you get lost again.,
1422,,Bud Elf,Finally... You're lucky my friends are around.,
1423,,Bud Elf,Come back... We may still be able to steer clear of the enemies.,
1424,,Aquaris,Please help me…,
1425,,Aquaris,Bring me to Guan Yin…,
1426,,Iron Fist & Bud Elf,……,
1427,,Bud Elf,Do you really want to do this?,
1428,,Aquaris,Yes.,
1429,,Iron Fist,"Guan Yin the ""Goddess of War"", is the best fighter in Academy. She scored a 98 in combat ability...",
1430,,Iron Fist,It's almost suicidal to meet her now.,
1431,,Aquaris,I know that... But I have to meet her.,
1432,,Iron Fist,There must be a reason for this. Could you tell us about it?,
1433,,Aquaris,……,
1434,,Aquaris,It was that operation against the infected of CHAOS FIGURE…,
1435,,Creature,(Squeak)...,
1436,,Aquaris,"Damn, they just keep coming... What should I do... I cannot defeat them all…",
1437,,Creature,(Squeak) ...!,
1438,,Aquaris,"Sorry, everyone... I... Can't make it…",
1439,,,"Get down, girl.",
1440,,Aquaris,！？,
1441,,Guan Yin,"I'm not even warmed up... Can you still move, little girl?",
1442,,Aquaris,Who? Me?,
1443,,Guan Yin,Very well.,
1444,,Aquaris,That's the whole story…,
1445,,Aquaris,"I owe Guan Yin my life. So no matter how small the chance is, I'm going to do it! Or…",
1446,,Aquaris,...I'll never forgive myself…,
1447,,Iron Fist,……,
1448,,Bud Elf,Let's just help her out.,
1449,,Iron Fist,Okay... I can't just leave her alone.,
1450,,Iron Fist,Bud Elf. Can you help us secretly bypass the Legion of Chaos's blockade?,
1451,,Bud Elf,Let me see…,
1452,,Bud Elf,I can do that,
1453,,Bud Elf,"So we're going for Guan Yin, just to take a glance. Don't make a sound, okay?",
1454,,Aquaris,Okay! Thanks everyone!,
1455,,Aquaris,Now let's find Guan Yin!,
1456,So close yet so far.,Bud Elf,(Whisper) This is it... There's no one else. And Guan Yin is right up ahead…,
1457,,Aquaris,(Whisper) Stay where you are. Let me go see her.,
1458,,Iron Fist,"(Whisper) Make it quick, we had a deal. It's just a quick visit…",
1459,,Aquaris,"(Whisper) Okay, got it.",
1460,,Bud Elf,(whisper) Aquaris... Are you really going to do more than that...?,
1461,,Iron Fist,(whisper) I also have a bad feeling about this…,
1462,,Aquaris,Guan Yin!!,
1463,,Evil Guan Yin,……,
1464,,Iron Fist,(Whisper) I knew that would happen…,
1465,,Iron Fist,"(Whisper) Bud Elf, get ready to act…",
1466,,Aquaris,(Whisper) Let me take care of this!,
1467,,Iron Fist & Bud Elf,……,
1468,,Aquaris,"(Whisper) No matter what, don't come out... Trust me.",
1469,,Evil Guan Yin,You...,
1470,,Evil Guan Yin,Invader...,
1471,,Aquaris,As expected... She still doesn't remember me…,
1472,,Aquaris,Just like that time…,
1473,,,Real combat training for Discipline Members,
1474,,,To improve the combat and survivability of Discipline Members against the CHAOS FIGURE threat.,
1475,,,The training was set up.,
1476,,,"Assigned by Michael, Joan invited her best friend as the coach---",
1477,,,"Guan Yin the ""Goddess of War""",
1478,,,"""Guan Yin senpai, look over here"" ""Senpai!""...",
1479,,,It's more like meeting a celebrity than a training program.,
1480,,Aquaris,I was there too.,
1481,,Aquaris,"I wanted to get closer. Show my gratitude, and told her I'll always support and follow her...",
1482,,Aquaris,Guan Yin senpai! Over here! Look over here~!,
1483,,Guan Yin,Oh?,
1484,,Aquaris,Thank you! Thank you for saving my life that day…!,
1485,,Guan Yin,"Hey, looking good! Cheer up~!",
1486,,Guan Yin,"Haha, thank you all~! Keep it up everyone…",
1487,,Aquaris,Guan Yin belongs to everyone... Everyone loves her.,
1488,,Aquaris,How could she notice me…,
1489,,Aquaris,...I'm just a nobody…,
1490,,Evil Guan Yin,……,
1491,,Aquaris,I... (Sighing) I know…,
1492,,Aquaris,"I'm just... Another fan... That's all,",
1493,,Aquaris,And all I can do... Is look up at you... But…,
1494,,Aquaris,But...,
1495,,Aquaris,Don't you remember...?,
1496,,Aquaris,The time we spent together in special training!!!,
1497,The Negate Scale,Guan Yin,How could I forget this time…,
1498,,Guan Yin,...Where is my belt?,
1499,,Guan Yin,There is still someone here? It's so late…,
1500,,Aquaris,(Deep breath)... Thrust! Follow up! Dodge! Then…,
1501,,Aquaris,Then what?..,
1502,,Aquaris,It's...,
1503,,Guan Yin,"After dodging, you should decide to counterattack or parry according to the rhythm of your foe.",
1504,,Guan Yin,"In order to do that, you'll need to understand their fighting styles. That requires extensive experience in actual combat.",
1505,,Aquaris,G.... GUAN YIN SENPAI!!!,
1506,,Aquaris,Why are you here...? It's so late...,
1507,,Aquaris,AHHHHHH!!!!,
1508,,Guan Yin,Haha~,
1509,,Aquaris,Oh no! She saw everything!!!,
1510,,Aquaris,It's too awkward!!!,
1511,,Guan Yin,Found it. It's here.,
1512,,Aquaris,"SsSSsSenpai, good bye~",
1513,,Guan Yin,"You should go back. Don't train too hard, it will ruin your performance tomorrow~",
1514,,Aquaris,"But, my training isn't good enough.",
1515,,Aquaris,"If I don't try harder, I will be left behind…",
1516,,Guan Yin,...What's your name?,
1517,,Aquaris,"My name is Aquaris, junior of this year~!",
1518,,Guan Yin,Aquaris... I will remember that name.,
1519,,Guan Yin,Come see me after dinner tomorrow. I'll arrange for you some targeted training practice.,
1520,,Guan Yin,Go back home and have a good rest.,
1521,,Aquaris,Special training?.................................................... Ok!,
1522,,Guan Yin,"I told you before, keep your balance! \n Are you a fool??",
1523,,Aquaris,Ahhh!!,
1524,,,Failed... Failed again... Always failing.,
1525,,,Guan Yin senpai's special training was strict and painful.,
1526,,,But it was the best time since enrolling in the Academy.,
1527,,,Targeted training plan... Flexible battle combat styles... And tactical analysis…,
1528,,,"And most importantly, standing beside Guan Yin senpai face to face…",
1529,,,It's simply something I couldn't even dream of... I was so happy.,
1530,,Aquaris,I can't do it anymore~ Ah---,
1531,,Guan Yin,Baka! I told you so many times. You need to see through the diversion!,
1532,,Aquaris,Be that as it may... But…,
1533,,Aquaris,I cannot... See through... Your diversion,
1534,,Aquaris,I can't tell... I... I'm burned out…,
1535,,Guan Yin,"Looks like it was me who has gone too far... Alright, that's it for today's training.",
1536,,Guan Yin,Go take a rest and leave~!,
1537,,Aquaris,(Deep breath)…,
1538,,Aquaris,"Senpai, may I ask you a question?",
1539,,Guan Yin,？,
1540,,Aquaris,Is that why you always turn your shoulder unnaturally when you are halfway through your Omnislash?,
1541,,Guan Yin,"Yes, and that's for releasing force. Otherwise, the turn around that comes after won't be as smooth.",
1542,,Aquaris,But... won't that cause a fracture?,
1543,,Guan Yin,So what?,
1544,,Aquaris,？,
1545,,Guan Yin,No skill is perfect.,
1546,,Guan Yin,"The balance will always break when you intervene, it's the rule for everything.",
1547,,Guan Yin,"Being afraid of a fracture, or stubbornly aiming for perfect balance... That will limit yourself.",
1548,,Guan Yin,"Know yourself, control yourself, then control your fracture, then---",
1549,,Guan Yin,"You may achieve the first step of ""Know thyself"", and plus…",
1550,,Guan Yin,"Even if there is a fracture in my Omnislash, who would be able to notice it?",
1551,,Aquaris,I... I don't understand~,
1552,,Guan Yin,Haha... BAKA~,
1553,,Guan Yin,You will know that when it is time!,
1554,,Guan Yin,Trust me!,
1555,,Aquaris,Senpai... Okay!,
1556,,Evil Guan Yin,……,
1557,,Aquaris,Senpai... Finally…,
1558,,Aquaris,Understand that…,
1559,,Aquaris,Come on Senpai! Let me show you…,
1560,,Aquaris,The outcome of my training!,
1561,,Evil Guan Yin,Ahhhhh!!!!,
1562,,Aquaris,Fracture... Got it!,
1563,,Aquaris,There is still the next move... How could it be?,
1564,,Guan Yin,You really think... I have don't care about that fracture?,
1565,,Guan Yin,"You didn't see that coming, Aquaris?",
1566,,Guan Yin,Drag the knife tactic... To series after series... Going to death and coming back to life again. It requires total calm and courage.,
1567,,Guan Yin,"When using this skill, my inner beast gets restricted again…",
1568,,Guan Yin,You're the first one to push me that far.,
1569,,Guan Yin,You didn't waste your time on special training…,
1570,,Guan Yin,...Aquaris.,
1571,,Aquaris,Senpai!!,
1572,,Guan Yin,What's that smell?,
1573,,Guan Yin,"(Sniff) Baka, what kind of food did you bring this time?!",
1574,,Aquaris,"Senpai, this is the last pork set meal at Yume Academy~",
1575,,Aquaris,I found it in Sonya's Cafeteria~ Saved it just for you!,
1576,,Aquaris,...Let's talk while eating~,
1577,,Aquaris,"Hey, the alarm is off~!",
1578,,Iron Fist & Bud Elf,………………,
1579,,Bud Elf,So…,
1580,,Iron Fist,"...is it Aquaris's special training that wakes up the ""Goddess of War""...",
1581,,Bud Elf,Or... is it because of the food?,
1582,,Aquaris,No more questions!,
1583,,Aquaris,It's the inner beast!,
1584,,Guan Yin,Well…,
10000001,Watching Cherry Blossoms - 00,,What am I doing here?,
10000002,,,"Once again, the sun is shining and the gentle breeze warms the day.",
10000003,,,The junior school girls have gone outside and embraced the bright sun after the winter.,
10000004,,,And I'm still sitting here...,
10000005,,,...How much longer do I have to wait?,
10000006,,*,This is giving me a headache… What should we do now?,Why not call her?
10000007,,,"I've been waiting for a long time, and being late isn't Iron Fist's style. I better call her.",
10000008,,,So I took out my phone and dial her number.,
10000009,,,[Dialing...],
10000010,,Iron Fist,Hello? Senpai...,
10000011,,,The call is answered almost immediately.,
10000012,,,There is anxiety with the usual fear and trembling in Iron Fist's voice?,
10000013,,,…Anything wrong?,
10000014,,Iron Fist,"Senpai, are… are you already there?",
10000015,,*,Yeah… Where are you now?,
10000016,,Iron Fist,"Senpai, I... I'm afraid I couldn't keep my promise...",
10000017,,*,Huh?,
10000018,,*,Why? Does KongMing want you to do something else?,
10000019,,Iron Fist,Not exactly...,
10000020,,*,"Iron Fist, so... are you alright?",
10000021,,Iron Fist,……,
10000022,,,The silence lasted for a moment.,
10000023,,Iron Fist,"Senpai, I... I feel kind of sick today. Maybe, we could go out another day?",
10000024,,*,Uh...,
10000025,,,I was surprised. I don't know what to say…,
10000026,,,"From talking to her on the phone, I could only hear her breath.",
10000027,,,It's slight and frequent. I can imagine how she looks now---,
10000028,,,"Calm, but also looking forward to something?",「Be brave!」|「Whatever you say~」
10000029,,*,Iron Fist… don't think too much.,
10000030,,Iron Fist,???,
10000031,,*,"You actually want to come, right?",
10000032,,Iron Fist,"I do, but...",
10000033,,*,"…If you really want to, there is nothing stopping you.",
10000034,,*,Trust me. And trust KongMing senpai.,
10000035,,Iron Fist,"Okay, I got it!",

10000037,,*,Why?,
10000038,,Iron Fist,Senpai look back---,
10000039,,,She hangs up before I could reply.,
10000040,,,"Confused, I come back to find out what she means.",
10000041,,,"Looks like there is no need to search. Iron Fist is standing in front of me, smiling.",
10000042,,,She seems a bit… different.,
10000043,,Iron Fist,(Smile) Hi~ Senpai~,
10000044,,*,"You look very excited, Iron Fist~",
10000045,,Iron Fist,(Smile) Senpai. To be honest... I've already been here for a long time...,
10000046,,Iron Fist,"After slowly, seeing everyone going out and having fun... I suddenly started to get scared.",
10000047,,*,……？,
10000048,,Iron Fist,"(Lonely Smile) After seeing your presence, I've been more… I couldn't say exactly…",
10000049,,,"And she continues talking like this. Her voice was gentle, just like a spring breeze.",
10000050,,,Many words that aren't normally heard was also included when she talks.,
10000051,,Iron Fist,…But after hearing Senpai's encouragement. I'm starting to think... Maybe I think too much…,
10000052,,*,Iron Fist.,
10000053,,Iron Fist,？,
10000054,,*,(Smile) You look very beautiful today.,
10000055,,Iron Fist,(Surprised) What?,
10000056,,Iron Fist,Thank you~!,
10000057,,Iron Fist,"Senpai, let's start off!",
10000058,,*,(Smile) Alright~,
10000059,,*,"Okay... Everything is fine with me. But, Iron Fist...",
10000060,,Iron Fist,Senpai?,
10000061,,*,Is this really what you want?,
10000062,,*,"And then when KongMing asks about this, you're going to tell...",
10000063,,Iron Fist,"KongMing senpai, she would...",
10000064,,,"The silent pause lasted for a moment, and Iron Fist breathes deeper and longer.",
10000065,,,"Finally, after a long break. I know...",
10000066,,,...She has made her decision.,
10000067,,Iron Fist,"Then... Okay, I understand.",
10000068,,Iron Fist,"Senpai, should we meet at the place?",
10000069,,*,"Alright, see you there.",
10000070,,,I'm early again.,
10000071,,,"But this time, I could hear footsteps coming closer.",
10000072,,Iron Fist,(Breathless) Senpai!,
10000073,,Iron Fist,I... I'm here!,
10000074,,Iron Fist,"(Concentrated) Wait a minute, I... (Deep breath)...",
10000075,,Iron Fist,(Excited) I'm ready!,
10000076,,Iron Fist,"Senpai, where should we go next?",
10000077,,*,Iron Fist.,

10000080,,Iron Fist,(Surprised) What?,
10000081,,Iron Fist,Thank you~,
10000082,,Iron Fist,"Senpai, let's start off!",
10000083,,*,(Smile) Alright~,
10000084,,Iron Fist,"Senpai, there are so many people out and about today.",
10000085,,*,Sakuras flowers don't bloom every day.,
10000086,,Iron Fist,So... they are all here to see them bloom?,
10000087,,*,Maybe.. Or maybe they are out for something else… Springtime is short. Gotta enjoy ourselves.,
10000088,,Iron Fist,"Senpai, look over there... Down the tree...",
10000089,,*,There are so many people.,
10000090,,Iron Fist,Wow--,
10000091,,,"Maybe by the atmosphere of the surrounding tourists, Iron Fist walks quicker and quicker.",
10000092,,,"Like flurries of pink clouds, sakura blooms, and blossoms.",
10000093,,,"Iron Fist enjoys herself within the pink clouds, having so much energy in the Spring.",
10000094,,,I have been walking closely with Iron Fist for awhile. Then I realized…,
10000095,,,…We are holding hands…,
10000096,,,I squeezed her hand.,
10000097,,,She turns back and faces me. We look into each other's eyes and smile at each other.,
10000098,,,"Finally, she slows down and we have a chance to stroll around. Side by side.",
10000099,,,and we didn't let go of each other's hands...,
10000100,,Iron Fist,"What's next, senpai?",
10000101,,,That question got me.,「Let's walk for a bit longer.」|「Why don't we just enjoy looking at sakura?」|「Sideshows?」|「Let's go home~」
10000102,,*,Well...,
10000103,,,"I hesitate a little, and there was no response. She is just looking at the surrounding sakura and tourists.",
10000104,,Iron Fist,Senpai?,
10000105,,*,"I was thinking... Since the sakura is blossoming right now, maybe...",
10000106,,Iron Fist,"Senpai, is that...?",
10000107,,Iron Fist,"You are going to find ""that tree?""",
10000108,,*,"Haha, you're right...",
10000109,,,I never thought that the idea would be so obvious. This is going to get awkward.,
10000110,,Iron Fist,Let's go!,
10000111,,*,Huh? Don't you...,
10000112,,Iron Fist,"I'm also very curious about the tree~! Thought you might laugh at me if I mention it, but never see this coming... Haha~!",
10000113,,Iron Fist,Let's go! Can't wait!,
10000114,,*,"(Sigh) Hey, just slow down...",
10000115,,*,Aren't you tired?,
10000116,,Iron Fist,I'm okay. I don't feel tired when I'm having fun…,
10000117,,Iron Fist,"Well, since you asked...",
10000118,,Iron Fist,"...Just, a little bit.",
10000119,,*,"Then let's go someplace else, shall we?",
10000120,,,"Iron Fist mutters to herself, looking at the sakura… and the tourists around her.",
10000121,,,"I'm thinking, maybe she's trying to recall all the beauty that was in her past.",
10000122,,*,I heard there is a sakura event at the food street on campus.,
10000123,,Iron Fist,(Excited) Then what are we waiting for???,
10000124,,Iron Fist,Let's go! I'm so happy~,
10000125,,*,"Hey, just slow down...",
10000126,Watching Cherry Blossoms - 10,,"There is a tale in the Academy, it's about a sakura tree that hides itself in the woods.",
10000127,,,And all the other sakura trees on campus comes from this tree.,
10000128,,,"And if you can find ""the tree""  when the sakura blooms, you will become truly happy.",
10000129,,,But the tale was so vague that it didn't count as a real tale.,
10000130,,,Nobody ever claimed to have seen this tree.,
10000131,,,"For all we know, they are rumors. It's just a bunch of hearsay.",
10000132,,,"Stupid, it's just... Stupid...",
10000133,,Iron Fist,"(Gasping for breath) Senpai, I think... We're...",
10000134,,Iron Fist,(Depressed) So silly...,
10000135,,*,Haha... I was going to say... The same sentence...,
10000136,,Iron Fist,Haha… Really…,
10000137,,Iron Fist,It doesn't even make sense...,
10000138,,,Iron Fist stares at me for a while and continues to walk forward.,
10000139,,,Looks like she has nothing else to say...,
10000140,,,In this type of situation… gotta change the subject.,
10000141,,,Say something... Just say something... But what to say?,「How do you feel now?」|「Why is KongMing not with you?」
10000142,,*,"(Reluctant) Haha... Iron Fist, don't get too tired.",
10000143,,*,How about let's relax a bit...,
10000144,,Iron Fist,……,
10000145,,Iron Fist,"Hahaha~ Senpai, please don't worry about me too much...",
10000146,,Iron Fist,I chose to do this…. and thanks for being with me all this time…,
10000147,,*,"After all, accompanying junior school girls is Senpai's responsibility.",
10000148,,Iron Fist,"(Smile) So, it's because of the responsibility?",
10000149,,,I smile at her without saying anything.,
10000150,,Iron Fist,"Well, I don't feel bad because of this.",
10000151,,*,Oh?,
10000152,,,The sound of birds chirping from a distance echoes into the woods.,
10000153,,Iron Fist,"No one else is here... Aquaris, Bud Elf, Raphael, Michael, and...",
10000154,,,Don't remember when... But we've been separated from the tourists and entered this area.,
10000155,,Iron Fist,Looks like we've lost track of everything...,
10000156,,*,Just as you said… I don't feel like myself.,
10000157,,Iron Fist,Hahaha...,
10000158,,,It looks like I found Iron Fist's sense of humor. She is laughing back and forth.,
10000159,,,Her laughter lasted for a while in the woods.,
10000160,,Iron Fist,Haha... I... almost lost... my breath... fu--,
10000161,,Iron Fist,"When I left the dorm this morning, my mood changed.",

10000164,,*,Here… I am not Senpai. And you…,
10000165,,*,You are not Iron Fist…,

10000170,,,"As Iron Fist's head lowered and her footsteps become slower, Iron Fist remained silent.",
10000171,,,Another wrong question... I just know it's too late.,
10000172,,Iron Fist,KongMing senpai… She is missing again.,
10000173,,Iron Fist,She left many tags though...,
10000174,,*,KongMing must be...,
10000175,,Iron Fist,...I know what is she is worried about. She hopes I would recover and enjoy the Sakura Festival,
10000176,,Iron Fist,But I… hope that she would relax.,
10000177,,Iron Fist,I know this is selfish thinking… KongMing senpai is for everyone.,
10000178,,Iron Fist,"The Academy and Student Union, they all need her... But, I just cannot stop thinking...",
10000179,,Iron Fist,even... even just for a day...,

10000190,,Iron Fist,What kind of bird is that?,
10000191,,,Whatever we do… The sky darkens… It's getting late.,
10000192,,,And we… couldn't find that sakura tree.,
10000193,,,Naive... We're too naive... No matter how nice we think it would be.,
10000194,,,A legend is just a legend.,
10000195,,,…It's not even a supernatural story…,
10000196,,Iron Fist,"Ah, Senpai,.... Senpai... (Deep breath)---",
10000197,,Iron Fist,You really want to find that tree?,「It's a shame to give up this early.」|「That would make Sakura Festival more unforgettable.」|「I hope you could see that~」|「What? I thought you would like it...」
10000198,,Iron Fist,So this is how it is...?,
10000199,,Iron Fist,"Okay, I understand.",
10000200,,Iron Fist,"Senpai, I've got a place to show you!",
10000201,,*,"(Surprised) Huh, what?",
10000202,,Iron Fist,Just follow me!,
10000203,,*,But we haven't even found it…,

10000206,,*,Okay....,
10000207,,Iron Fist,(Surprised) Huh?,
10000208,,Iron Fist,It's okay. I didn't care about that tree anyways.,
10000209,,Iron Fist,And I really appreciate that you're here with me for so long!,
10000210,,*,Really...,
10000211,,Iron Fist,I'm serious... Now I don't care about the tree anymore...,

10000213,,Iron Fist,"There were still fun things to do at the Sakura Festival, right?",
10000214,,*,In that case…. Shall we go back?,

10000231,,KongMing,Iron Fist... A coincidence?,
10000232,,Sapphire,KongMing. Who is this…?,
10000233,,Iron Fist,KongMing senpai... What brings you here?,
10000234,,Kong Ming,The festival won't be around for the whole year. I am just here to relax.,

10000242,,*,Have fun~!,
10000243,,*,"So Iron Fist, what's next...  Iron Fist?",
10000244,,,Iron Fist isn't responding. She is looking at the crowd in the distance.,
10000245,,,She becomes silent all of a sudden.,
10000246,,,Just like a rock in the sea.,

10000252,,Iron Fist,？,
10000253,,*,"Clearly, Kong Ming and Sapphire are simply out having fun?",
10000254,,Iron Fist,(Unexpected surprise)……,

10000257,,,"Because of that moment, she is thinking too much.",
10000258,,,Too much for someone like her.,

10000268,,*,What makes you say that?,
10000269,,Iron Fist,I always thought whether it would be improper...,
10000270,,Iron Fist,...To hang out and look at these flowers even when KongMing senpai is that busy.,
10000271,,Iron Fist,"In other words, just because KongMing senpai is that busy.",
10000272,,Iron Fist,I should be happier and more devoted.,

1672,,Phoenix,"Hurry up, let's go!",
1673,,Phoenix,Commander!,
1674,,Commander,Phoenix…,
1675,,Phoenix,How bad is it?,
1676,,Commander,Just… barely escaped death… All thanks to Linky…,
1677,,Linky,"I am Linky, from Regiment Alpha. Master, uh... I meant captain, ordered me to support you guys!",
1678,,Linky,You look like a strong soldier… What is your name?,
1679,,Phoenix,"I am Phoenix, a captain of Regiment Omega!",
1680,,Linky,Our team received orders to breach the defense forces of the Legion of Chaos.,
1681,,Linky,"However, what we faced were not the elite troops, but the guerilla forces.",
1682,,Linky,Captain was worried that the majority of the Legion has already been transferred...,
1683,,Linky,and sent me as a backup.,
1684,,Phoenix,Your captain guessed right.,
1685,,Phoenix,"As soon as our team was dispatched, we were assaulted by the Legion of Chaos.",
1686,,Phoenix,They sent their forces through the Singularity by utilizing teleportation abilities.,
1687,,Commander,The Singularity is compromised… This is bad!,
1688,,Phoenix,Madam…,
1689,,Commander,Go on!,
1690,,Phoenix,There was also an uncountable amount of Terror Figures.,
1691,,Phoenix,The Legion of Chaos is putting everything they have here!,
1692,,Commander,They confused the HQ and moved their main troops elsewhere.,
1693,,Commander,"Regiment Omega is out-matched,",
1694,,Commander,...And they also brought the Terror Figures with them…,
1695,,Phoenix,"Anyway, let's get out of here!",
1696,Dark Knight,Vice-Captain,Finally…,
1697,,Linky,"Phoenix, the commander has lost consciousness!",
1698,,Phoenix,I have the medical supplies here. Let's first stop her from bleeding!,
1699,,Phoenix,Where is Fivie and Sixie?,
1700,,Vice-Captain,They are gone…,
1701,,Dark Knight,It's over…,
1702,,Dark Knight,Face the judgement of the underworld!,
1703,,Phoenix,Watch out!,
1704,,Dark Knight,Interesting… You dare to stand up to me?,
1705,,Dark Knight,But this ends now…!,
1706,,Dark Knight,Huh? You're a lot weaker than I thought…,
1707,It's not over yet!,Dark Knight,It's over~,
1708,,Dark Knight,It's over--- All of it!,
1709,,Dark Knight,Mwahahahahahahahaha----,
1710,,Vice-Captain,"Cap, captain…",
1711,,Vice-Captain,Ahhhh!!!!!,
1712,,Fivie,"Wow, Captain, that was incredible!",
1713,,Commander,"Phoenix, leave me alone…",
1714,,Linky,Go!!!,
1715,,Phoenix,What… is going on?,
1716,,Commander,"Farewell, Phoenix…",
1717,,Dark Knight,Now that was a disappointment…!,
1718,,Phoenix,……,
1719,,Linky,"Wake up, Phoenix, it's not your time yet!",
1720,,Dark Knight,This is the true power of the Terror Figure…,
1721,,Dark Knight,A truly befitting gift from the Ruler of Chaos himself!,
1722,,Phoenix,Madam?!,
1723,,Dark Knight,This ends everything!,
1724,,Phoenix,"Madam, please come back to us!",
1725,,Dark Knight,It's time to sweep the battlefields!,
1726,,Phoenix,"Please… Please come back, madam…",
1727,,Dark Knight,"Minions, enjoy this moment!",
1728,,Phoenix,Damn it!!,
1729,,Phoenix,Ahhhh!!!!!,
1730,,Legion Soldier,B... Boss…,
1731,,Dark Knight,"Stop calling me ""Boss"", call me ""Sir Knight""!",
1732,,Legion Soldier,The light… The light is burning my eyes…!!,
1733,,Legion Soldier,An... An angel is here?,
1734,,Dark Knight,Shut up!,
1735,,Linky,Is that… Phoenix?!,
1736,,Phoenix,It's... not... over... yet...!,
1737,,Dark Knight,"You never know when to stay down, do you?",
1738,,Dark Knight,Go get her!,
1739,Reborn,Linky,"Phoenix, are you alright?",
1740,,Linky,Take this first-aid kit. Fix yourself up!,
1741,,Phoenix,"Don't worry, I'm fine! This ain't over yet!",
1742,,Dark Knight,What?! You can still fight?!,
1743,,Dark Knight,Whatever! This could be fun~,
1744,,Dark Knight,The flame is burning in this war~,
1745,,Dark Knight,"I will ""take good care"" of you~",
1746,,Dark Knight,"And unlike you guys, the great Castner never disappoints!",
1747,,Linky,Phoenix，watch out!!!,
1748,,Dark Knight,Rest in peace!,
1749,,Legion Soldier,B... Boss……,
1750,,Legion Soldier,The flame……,
1751,,Dark Knight,How could this happen?,
1752,,Dark Knight,Impossible!!! No one can survive from my Efreet!,
1753,,Phoenix,That won't help.,
1754,,Phoenix,Your Efreet can't stop me!,
1755,,Phoenix,"To me, death is just a beginning...",
1756,,Phoenix,I will become stronger than ever after rising from the ashes!,
1757,Interrogation,Phoenix,How did you learn about the location of the Singularity?,
1758,,Dark Knight,Do you think making a comeback will change anything?,
1759,,Linky,Just say it! Who told you that?,
1760,,Dark Knight,Do you really think I would spill everything out while I'm under pressure?,
1761,,Dark Knight,Too naive! Give up already.,
1762,,Linky,You're…… despicable!,
1763,,Phoenix,This is your last chance!,
1764,,Phoenix,...or I'll give you hell!,
1765,,Dark Knight,No one has ever done this to me!,
1766,,Dark Knight,And after what I've seen…Nothing can scare me anymore!,
1767,,Dark Knight,Watch me.,
1768,,Dark Knight,No! Stop! Ahhh------,
1769,,Linky,"Phoenix, you're so strong!",
1770,,Phoenix,I still can't gain full control of my powers……,
1771,,Phoenix,I should be more relaxed next time.,
1772,Who's the traitor?,Phoenix,So who is the traitor?,
1773,,Linky,My master told me to locate the Singularity...,
1774,,Linky,...You must have the power to navigate time and space.,
1775,,Linky,"The Singularity is permanent, but the sequence of time and space is not.",
1776,,Linky,We still haven't found its pattern yet...,
1777,,Phoenix,...whether its the power of teleportation or decoding the location of the Singularity...,
1778,,Phoenix,Few have those abilities on campus...,
1779,,Phoenix,And I haven't met any of them yet.,
1780,,Linky,Neither have I...,
1781,,Phoenix,If they teleported from the Singularity...,
1782,,Phoenix,...Then the main force of our enemy and most of the Terror Figures…,
1783,,Phoenix,...should still be on the battlefield?!,
1784,,Linky,!!!,
1785,,Linky,"OMG, Master is in danger!",
1786,,Linky,"Phoenix, help me clean up the ambushers. Let's get back to the HQ!",
1787,,Phoenix,Copy!,
1788,Annihilated,Linky,Damn it! We're too late!,
1789,,Linky,Regiment Alpha won't be defeated this easily!,
1790,,Phoenix,Soldiers of the Legion of Chaos are clearing the field.,
1791,,Linky,"Why don't we just ""ask"" them!",
1792,,Linky,It can't be…… Master won't die!,
1793,,Linky,We are the invictus Squad 11 of Regiment Alpha!,
1794,,Phoenix,I'll go check that area!,
1795,,Phoenix,"Linky, I see a sword!",
1796,,Linky,"A sword?! Wait, let me see!",
1797,,Phoenix,It's over there!,
1798,,Linky,This is Master's sword……,
1799,,Linky,She once said that it's a part of her life...,
1800,,Linky,and that she will not give it up unless she dies……,
1801,,Linky,Master must be here!,
1802,,Phoenix,"Linky, slow down. Your hands are bleeding!",
1803,,Linky,"Master, hang on! I'm coming……",
1804,,Linky,The badge…… the Armband……And the pocket watch I gave her!,
1805,,Linky,It's Master!!!,
1806,,Linky,"Phoenix, come and help me!",
1807,,Linky,"Master, it's Linky, wake up!",
1808,,Phoenix,"Linky, she's already……",
1809,,Linky,Master!!! No——,
1810,Duties & Choices,Phoenix,"Linky, what's next?",
1811,,Linky,No…… This can't be real! There must be another way.,
1812,,Phoenix,Linky...,
1813,,Linky,I believe there is a way...,
1814,,Linky,That could bring master and everyone from Regiment Alpha back.,
1815,,Phoenix,But…… (There's no guarantee it could work.),
1816,,Linky,"No matter how much it will cost, I'm going to find it!",
1817,,Phoenix,But the Chaos invasion isn't over……,
1818,,Linky,Master means everything to me!,
1819,,Linky,"Goodbye, Phoenix!",
1820,,Phoenix,"Linky, how can you leave just like that?",
1821,,Phoenix,"And Commander, you still owe me this month's salary!",
1822,,Phoenix,"Vice-captain, you are always fussing over us, but I miss it now…",
1823,,Phoenix,Fivie and Sixie……,
1824,,Phoenix,And everyone of Regiment Omega……,
1825,,Phoenix,I'll end this war! No matter how hard it is...,
1826,,Phoenix,"I'll find the traitor, and avenge everyone!",
1827,,Phoenix,"So, let's start with these terror figures!",
1828,I am Destruction!,Michael,"Linky, welcome back to Yume Academy!",
1829,,Michael,Make yourself at home.,
1830,,Michael,"If you need any help, you know where to find me!",
1831,,Linky,Though it's different from what it used to be...,
1832,,Linky,All thanks to Phoenix...,
1833,,Linky,I can find everything I need now!,
1834,,Michael,Outstanding! That's the Senpai who I admire!,
1835,,Michael,"By the way,  the student files database is damaged because of the Chaos invasion...",
1836,,Michael,"Therefore, our Discipline members will need to record and upload the files of every single student again.",
1837,,Michael,I understand that bringing up your past will fill you with pain and agony...,
1838,,Michael,But this is to ensure better management of the Academy. I hope you understand!,
1839,,Linky,Alright... So where should I start?,
1840,,Michael,Please start from the beginning!,
1841,,,"Linky looks out from the window, saying ""The beginning"", memories flowed out like a river.",
1842,,,She is unable to remember when or how did she first come to Yume Academy. She only remember that it was at the time of the first wave of Chaos invasion.,
1843,,,"As one of the first-generation students, She trained her ability from day to night under the instruction of her coach.",
1844,,Linky,"(It took me 10 moves this time... I made a mistake, could have finished her off faster!",
1845,,Linky,"With a heavier thrust, I'll be able to take her down in 8 moves! Again!!!)",
1846,,,Spear thrust into the flesh and the victim couldn't stop screaming.,
1847,,Trainee A,Linky!!!,
1848,,Trainee B,How could you?! This is just training!,
1849,,Trainee C,"This is the 46th time you injured a trainee! You did it on purpose, didn't you?",
1850,,Linky,What did I do wrong? Shouldn't we hold nothing back in combat?,
1851,,Trainee B,Hmph! You did it on purpose! It doesn't make sense to beat your sparring partner into the infirmary!,
1852,,Linky,Sparring partners? Do you mean the ones who cannot even hold their spears properly?,
1853,,Linky,Soo cocky!!,
1854,,Trainee A&B,Linky!!!,
1855,,Linky,"If I were you, I'd spend time practicing how to hold a spear properly instead of arguing!",
1856,,Linky,There will be no mercy in combat! Especially when you're fighting the Legion of Chaos!,
1857,,Trainee A,Cut the crap! We should let her feel how being wounded feels like!,
1858,,Coach,Stop! All of you!,
1859,,Coach,This is a training field! Not an arena!,
1860,,Trainee A,Ma'am! Linky started all this!,
1861,,Trainee B,She put 46 teammates in the infirmary during training!,
1862,,Trainee C,"We tried to reason with her, but she refused to apologize. She even laughed at us!",
1863,,Coach,Linky!,
1864,,Coach,Tell me why you stabbed your teammates!,
1865,,Coach,Don't you know that you can only rely on them in the battlefield?,
1866,,Linky,"Tch, my teammates can't even hold their weapons right!",
1867,,Linky,I want teammates! Not people who drag me down when we're fighting!,
1868,,Coach,How dare you!,
1869,,Coach,"According to Cpt.6 of Art.3 of your Student handbook, your punishment starts now...",
1870,,Coach,You will run laps in the training field. Don't stop without an order!!!,
1871,,Linky,"Whatever, I'm too bored to argue with you weaklings!",
1872,,Linky,"(Damn, why is it always me? I trained harder than anyone else!",
1873,,Linky,I didn't mean to hurt them. I just couldn't control myself when I'm fighting...),
1874,Assemble!,Coach,All units! Stand at ease! Attention!,
1875,,Coach,The Chaos invasion is getting worse. Push them back...,
1876,,Coach,"After a long discussion, the HQ has decided to assemble a united force for Yume!",
1877,,Trainee A,A united force for Yume?!,
1878,,Trainee B,What's that?,
1879,,Coach,"To build up force, we'll need to pick some strong students and assemble them into elite teams.",
1880,,Linky,A student who is strong... That describes me perfectly!,
1881,,Trainee A,Don't even think about it. You don't even know what teamwork is!,
1882,,Trainee B,That's right!,
1883,,Linky,Wait and see!,
1884,,Coach,Listen up! I'll teach you each and everyone one of you personally...,
1885,,Coach,Those who perform well in the test will be able to join one of the 4 regiments.,
1886,,Coach,According to my suggestion and your preference.,
1887,,Linky,"Coach, what's the difference between the 4 regiments?",
1888,,Coach,Regiment Omega is in charge of the supply issue. Regiment Sigma provides long-distance fire support in battles.,
1889,,Coach,Regiment Alpha focuses on combat in the front-line. Regiment Beta is responsible for the defense.,
1890,,Coach,"And now, we will start the test!",
1891,,Coach,The trainee will come to me for the test once she is called!,
1892,,Linky,"Ugh, why does it take this long?",
1893,,Linky,I'll fall asleep if they keep me waiting any longer!,
1894,,Coach,Linky!,
1895,,Linky,Linky reporting in!,
1896,,Coach,Are you ready?,
1897,,Linky,"Ready when you are! Let's begin, Coach!",
1898,,Coach,Very well! You've made great progress!,
1899,,Coach,You're good at spear fighting and have fast reflexes...,
1900,,Coach,This makes you suitable for regiment Alpha. A lot of battles will be waiting for you there.,
1901,,Linky,"Haha, I can't think of any better group to be a part of!",
1902,,Linky,There's nothing more exciting than fighting!,
1903,,Coach,"Now, you can go and find some others to form a squad!",
1904,,Linky,So this place is the camp for Regiment Alpha?,
1905,,Trainee C,Huh?! It's Linky!!!,
1906,,Trainee C,Why are you here?!,
1907,,Linky,Hey~ Never thought a weakling like you passed the test!,
1908,,Linky,You better not hold this regiment back!,
1909,,Trainee A,That's what I was about to say!,
1910,,Trainee B,Someone who goes crazy attacking her own teammates is the biggest threat to the team!,
1911,,Trainee A,I'm not going to team up with her. What about you guys?,
1912,,Trainee C,Neither will I!,
1913,,Trainee B,"I don't want to either! Linky, just go away! We won't team up with you!",
1914,,Linky,"Tch, whatever! I 'll look for better people to team up with!",
1915,Squad 11,Linky,"Tch, I don't want to team up any of you either! I'm 10 times stronger than all of you!",
1916,,Linky,You won't survive real combat and I won't save you!,
1917,,Linky,Y'all a bunch of fools! What are you doing holding grudges?,
1918,,Linky,I didn't mean to stab them...,
1919,,Linky,Do they have to gang up on me and bring this up every time?,
1920,,Linky,I don't want to see them ever again!,
1921,,Enigma,"The long-haired girl with a heavy drill... You must be Linky, right?",
1922,,Linky,What do you want?,
1923,,Enigma,"I'm Enigma, the team leader of Squad 11, Regiment Alpha.",
1924,,Enigma,I've heard of your abilities a long time ago.,
1925,,Enigma,"Since you are not teamed up yet, may I invite you to join Squad 11?",
1926,,Linky,My outstanding ability... She's praising me~,
1927,,Linky,This Enigma has a good eye!,
1928,,Linky,"But, you cannot convince me just by praising me!)",
1929,,Linky,"Sorry, but there're too many invitations from other squads!",
1930,,Linky,"(Haha~ Enigma, invite me again. Show me your sincerity!)",
1931,,Enigma,Too many invitations? That's not what I heard.,
1932,,Enigma,"Actually, you're the only one who currently doesn't have a team~",
1933,,Enigma,The coach has just announced that those who cannot find a squad to join before dinner...,
1934,,Enigma,...will be denied membership!,
1935,,Enigma,"So, join my squad now!",
1936,,Linky,I don't care!,
1937,,Linky,I'm strong enough to form a one-man team. I don't need any burdens!,
1938,,Enigma,"Seriously? Linky, bragging won't help you!",
1939,,Linky,Try me! I'll take on any challenge!,
1940,,Enigma,And when you lose?,
1941,,Linky,How can that happen!?,
1942,,Enigma,"Well, here's the deal!",
1943,,Enigma,"Let's have a match. If I win, you'll have to enter Squad 11.",
1944,,Linky,"Sure, but what if you lose?",
1945,,Enigma,That won't happen! Just get ready to join my team!,
1946,,Linky,Damn! That doesn't count. Again!,
1947,,Enigma,You should keep your promise~,
1948,,Enigma,Welcome to Squad 11!,
1949,,Linky,Just for now!,
1950,,Linky,I'll defeat you next time!,
1951,,Enigma,I'm always available!,
1952,Battle of the Valley-Part I,,The 98th year of the invasion of Chaos,
1953,,,Linky was ordered to lead her team to the east front-line secretly...,
1954,,,And lead the assault on the secret stronghold of Legion of Chaos.,
1955,,Teammate  A,"Ah, it's too hot! I can't stand it anymore! Does anybody have anything to drink?",
1956,,Linky,"Here, take it!",
1957,,Teammate  A,"Uh, I feel alive again!",
1958,,Teammate  A,"Linky, why are we deployed on such a hot day?!",
1959,,Linky,According to the message received from the captain this morning...,
1960,,Linky,...Regiment Sigma detected a secret enemy stronghold east of the valley.,
1961,,Linky,"In order to avoid Regiment Beta from being surrounded, we are ordered to destroy the stronghold.",
1962,,Linky,"If you're well-rested, let's move out! There's still a long way to go!",
1963,,Linky,Shh---! What's that?!,
1964,,Teammate  A,It sounds like...,
1965,,Teammate  A,Oh no! It's the Legion of Chaos!,
1966,,Linky,It's an ambush! Arm yourselves!,
1967,,Teammate  A,"Linky, what should we do?",
1968,,Teammate  A,They're overwhelming us!,
1969,,Linky,Send a message to the captain now!,
1970,,Linky,This is Linky to Captain! Come in!,
1971,,Linky,My team has been ambushed in the east of the valley...,
1972,,Linky,Requesting immediate assistance!,
1973,,Enigma,Copy! Reinforcement is on its way!,
1974,,Enigma,Please hold the line before they arrive!,
1975,,Enigma,"The battle in the valley could alter the tide. We can't afford to lose this, Linky!",
1976,,Linky,Copy that! Over and out!,
1977,,Teammate B,"Linky, they're rounding up!",
1978,,Linky,Hold the line. Close your rank!,
1979,Battle of the Valley-Part II,Teammate B,"Vice-Captain, they are all… Gone…!",
1980,,Linky,Watch out!,
1981,,Linky,Get behind that rock!,
1982,,,The sound of the explosion and Teammate B's painful screams could be heard.,
1983,,Linky,Stay with me!,
1984,,Teammate B,"Vi... Vice-captain, I don't think I can make it…",
1985,,Teammate B,I'm sorry… For not being able to stay by your side…,
1986,,Linky,Reinforcement is on its way. Just hold on for a little bit longer…!,
1987,,Linky,Wake up…,
1988,,Linky,Just hold on… for just a little bit…!,
1989,,Linky,I won't let you die in vain…,
1990,,Linky,"As long as I am alive, no enemy shall pass under my watch!",
1991,,Linky,"Come at me, Legion of Chaos! Today you will feel my wrath!",
1992,,Legion Officer,"Mwahahahaha, just give up already, Linky!",
1993,,Linky,Give up? That thought has never passed my mind. Not even once!,
1994,,Legion Officer,"Hm, rebellious girls like you irk me to no end…",
1995,,Legion Officer,"If death is what you want, then I could help arrange it for you!",
1996,Battle of the Valley-Part III,Legion Officer,Intriguing… but are you sure about your decision?,
1997,,Legion Officer,Our troops were here for over half a month...,
1998,,Legion Officer,And even the intel that you're receiving was sent by us!,
1999,,Linky,What?! Those were from you?!,
2000,,Legion Officer,Surprise~ Surprise~,
2001,,Legion Officer,"Hmmm, I changed my mind…",
2002,,Legion Officer,"I want to see the look in your face once you see your precious backup get annihilated. That sounds quite fun, doesn't it?",
2003,,Linky,Shut up! Shut up!!,
2004,,Linky,No one… Shall pass…,
2005,,Enigma,Linky!!!,
2006,,Linky,No one… Shall pass…,

2009,,Enigma,"Linky, watch out!!!",
2010,,Enigma,Argh......,
2011,,Linky,That voice… Captain? Is that you?,
2012,,Linky,Captain… I have been waiting for you for so long…,
2013,,Linky,"Captain, are you hurt?",
2014,,Enigma,"Linky, you've finally come back to your senses!",
2015,,Enigma,"You almost fell off a cliff, I was really worried!",
2016,,Linky,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to stab you…",
2017,,Enigma,"It's okay, Linky, I know you didn't mean it. Well done!",
2018,,Linky,"Captain, everyone else is gone…",
2019,,Enigma,"Good girl, you let no one through… and our line of defense still stands.",
2020,,Enigma,The cavalry is here. Leave the rest to us!,
2021,,Linky,"I can still fight! Captain, no, Master, I will avenge everyone's deaths!",
2022,,Enigma,"Let's do this together, shall we?",
2023,It's a Trap!,,"Six days after the Yartta Victory, Regiment Alpha received orders from the HQ: Break the final defense line of the Legion of Chaos, and end the war once and for all!",
2024,,Linky,"Master, is this really the Legion's main camp?",
2025,,Linky,Even though we have an advantage…,
2026,,Linky,This kind of emptiness isn't normal.,
2027,,Enigma,"Exactly, this has been bothering me too.",
2028,,Enigma,Since the moment that we arrived...,
2029,,Enigma,I have only seen a handful of Legion soldiers.,
2030,,Linky,They haven't done much aside from howling nonsensically.,
2031,,Enigma,Which got me thinking... What are those Legion soldiers really up to?,
2032,,Linky,"Master, watch out!",
2033,,Linky,"Master, are you hurt?",
2034,,Enigma,Not even a scratch!,
2035,,Enigma,"Linky, the Legion of Chaos won't fight us directly. They're focusing on guerilla warfare…",
2036,,Enigma,This leads me to believe that they're just bluffing.,
2037,,Linky,Do you mean that the Legion has been… Luring us away from each other? Breaking us apart?,
2038,,Enigma,"Exactly! Linky, I think we have been tricked!",
2039,,Linky,Tricked?!,
2040,,Enigma,No time to explain!,
2041,,Enigma,Go check on the Supply Camp...,
2042,,Enigma,I'll handle everything from here!,
2043,,Linky,"Yes, Master!",
2044,Supply Camp,Linky,My god... How can this be happening?!,
2045,,Linky,Even the Terror Figures are here!,
2046,,Linky,What is the Legion of Chaos aiming to do?!,
2047,,Linky,I need to find the Quartermaster of the Supply Camp quickly!,
2048,,Survivor,Curse the Legion!,
2049,,Survivor,Is anyone over there? Help!,
2050,,Linky,How are you feeling? Can you walk?,
2051,,Survivor,"Nothing too bad, but I need a hand!",
2052,,Survivor,"You're not from Regiment Omega, are you?",
2053,,Linky,"I am Linky, Second-in-command of Squad 11 with Regiment Alpha. Master has sent me as backup!",

2055,,Survivor,Follow me!,
2056,,Survivor,Madam!!!,
2057,,Commander,Stay away! No-------,
2058,,,The Dark Knight attacked the commander.,

2060,,Commander,And who are you?,
2061,,Linky,"I am Linky, Second-in-command of Squad 11 with Regiment Alpha.",
2062,,Phoenix,Commander! How bad is it?,
2063,,Commander,Just… barely escaped death… all thanks to Linky…,
2064,,Linky,"I am Linky, from Regiment Alpha. Master, uh, I meant captain, sent me here to support your squad!",
2065,,Linky,You look like a strong soldier… What is your name?,
2066,,Phoenix,"I am Phoenix, captain of Regiment Omega!",
2067,,Linky,Our team received orders to breach the defense forces of the Legion of Chaos.,
2068,,Linky,"But what we just faced wasn't elite troops, but guerilla forces.",
2069,,Linky,Captain was worried that the majority of the Legion has already been transferred...,
2070,,Linky,and sent me as a backup.,
2071,,Phoenix,Your captain guessed right.,
2072,,Phoenix,"As soon as our Squad was dispatched, we were assaulted by the Legion of Chaos.",
2073,,Phoenix,They sent their forces through the Singularity by utilizing teleportation abilities.,
2074,,Phoenix,The Singularity has been compromised.,
2075,,Phoenix,There were also an uncountable number of Terror Figures.,
2076,,Phoenix,The Legion of Chaos is putting everything they have here!,
2077,Wiped Out,Linky,So who is the traitor?,
2078,,Linky,I heard Master said to locate the Singularity...,
2079,,Linky,You must have the power to navigate time and space.,
2080,,Linky,"The Singularity is permanent, but the sequence of time and space is not.",
2081,,Linky,We still haven't found its pattern yet...,
2082,,Phoenix,...whether its the power of teleportation or decoding the location of the Singularity...,
2083,,Phoenix,Few have those abilities on campus...,
2084,,Phoenix,And I haven't met any of them yet.,
2085,,Linky,If they teleported from the Singularity...,
2086,,Linky,...Then the main force of our enemy and most of the Terror Figures…,
2087,,Linky,...should be still in the battlefield?!,
2088,,Phoenix,！！！,
2089,,Linky,"OMG, Master is in danger!",
2090,,Linky,"Phoenix, help me clean up the ambushers. Let's get back to HQ!",
2091,,Linky,"Damn it, we're too late!",
2092,,Linky,It can't be…… Master won't die!,
2093,,Linky,We are the Invictus Squad 11 of Regiment Alpha!,
2094,,Phoenix,"Linky, I see a sword!",
2095,,Linky,This is Master's sword……,
2096,,Linky,She once said that it's a part of her life...,
2097,,Linky,...and that she will not give it up unless she dies...,
2098,,Linky,Master must be here!,
2099,,Linky,"Master, hang on! I'm coming……",
2100,,Linky,The badge…… the armband…… and the pocket watch I gave her!,
2101,,Linky,It's master!!!,
2102,,Linky,"Phoenix, come and help me!",
2103,,Linky,"Master, it's Linky, wake up!",
2104,,Phoenix,"Linky, she's already……",
2105,,Linky,Master!!! No——,
2106,A new journey,Linky,No… This can't be real!,
2107,,Enigma,"Since you are not teamed up yet, why not join Squad 11?",
2108,,Enigma,"Let's duel. If I win, you'll have to enter Squad 11.",
2109,,Linky,Master is strong… She can't be defeated by mere Legion soldiers!,
2110,,Linky?,Why did you leave her?,
2111,,Enigma,"Linky, you almost fell off a cliff just now. I was worried!",
2112,,Linky,Master... Master...,
2113,,Linky?,You shouldn't have gone… Master died a painful and lonely death…,
2114,,Enigma,"Linky, you've done well!",
2115,,Linky,"Master… If I stayed by your side, would you have survived?",
2116,,Linky?,The deaths of Master and everyone in Squad 11… It was all on you!,
2117,,Linky,Vengence is mine!,
2118,,Linky?,Kill! Destroy!! Avenge your Squadmates!!,
2119,,Linky?,Bring death to those who killed your loved ones!,
2120,,Linky,Argh......,
2121,,Phoenix,"Linky, you finally woke up! I was worried!",
2122,,Linky,I will not let Master die!,
2123,,Phoenix,Linky...,
2124,,Linky,I believe there exists a method...,
2125,,Linky,...that could bring master and everyone from Regiment Alpha back.,
2126,,Linky,"No matter the cost, I'm going to find it!",
2127,,Phoenix,But……(There's no guarantee to this.),
2128,,Linky,No matter how many time it will take.,
2129,,Linky,"As long as I live, I will do anything,",
2130,,Linky,if it means that I can bring everyone back!,
2131,,Phoenix,But the invasion of Chaos is not over……,
2132,,Linky,Master means everything to me!,
2133,,Linky,"Farewell, Phoenix...",
2134,,Michael,What happened next?,
2135,,Linky,I went on a quest to learn the arts of reviving.,
2136,,Michael,And was there anything interesting on that quest?,
2137,,Linky,It's a long story.,
2138,,Michael,"Oh my, it's dinner time!",
2139,,Michael,The bakery has baked some vanilla cakes today. They will sell out soon!,
2140,,Michael,"Linky, let's talk later, okay?",
2141,,Linky,Of course!,
2142,Make-up Day,Poor Student A,Report——,

2403,,,"KongMing went through the documents, trying to remember what she was doing before.",
2404,,KongMing,Voila!,
2405,,,"After rereading it, KongMing finally found where she stopped writing and continued:",
2406,,KongMing,"""To everyone in the Student Union:",
2407,,KongMing,It's only a matter of time before the CHAOS FIGURE takes over me completely.,
2408,,KongMing,"To prevent it from spreading any further, and to avoid any danger I may bring to you….",
2409,,KongMing,…We must cut off all contacts with each other. Starting now.... The Student Union is disbanded.,
2410,,KongMing,The Discipline Committee will take over our position as rule-enforcer in the Academy. On the other hand…,
2411,,KongMing,"I need all of you to start working in secret, so the CHAOS FIGURE will not directly infect our network...",
2412,,KongMing,...And to avoid unnecessary attention.,
2413,,KongMing,Please continue investigating any ties between CHAOS FIGURE and the 7 mysteries of the Academy…,
2414,,KongMing,"I have heard voices within the chaos, which came from unreachable places…",
2415,,KongMing,They spoke about the 7 mysteries as if there are far more than 7…,
2416,,KongMing,It felt like something ancient. Something that we should be familiar with…,
2417,,*,Good work! KongMing.,
2418,,KongMing,"……You again, Senpai?",
2419,,*,How can I let our adorable prodigy KongMing do all the hard work?,
2420,,*,"Your little adventures in this place... Your ""Chaos Surfing""... Is worrying me a lot~",
2421,,KongMing,Chaos Surfing... What a nice name...,
2422,,KongMing,Was all of this a part of your plans?,
2423,,*,Well… Did you find out already?,
2424,,*,"No no no, I only hinted at the possibilities.",
2425,,*,There is no need for me to actually do anything. Isn't there. KongMing?,
2426,,KongMing,"(Shakes head) Any lead. Even the tiniest one,",
2427,,KongMing,will spur me into action by my thirst for knowledge and the urge to prove myself.,
2428,,*,Exactly. Leaving a patient for you to examine was more than enough.,
2429,,KongMing,You know me very well… But is this all that you wanted to do?,
2430,,KongMing,To corrupt us with the CHAOS FIGURE and to destroy the Academy?,
2431,,KongMing,That requires no scheming at all. Your aim is something way larger than this…,
2432,,*,"Pfft…Of course, I am! This is just the beginning, I…",
2433,,*,"……Very cunning, KongMing.",
2434,,KongMing,Too bad you didn't fall for it.,
2435,,*,"All expected from KongMing, the youngest leader of the Student Union…. The Finest of the Yume Academy….. The smartest of them all…",
2436,,KongMing,You always wanted to corrupt me?,
2437,,*,"In fact, you were my first target. But you were too well-protected…",
2438,,KongMing,That's why you chose Lucifer instead.,
2439,,*,I didn't even have to lift a finger to do that. Her brains were already filled with muscle anyway...,
2440,,KongMing,You are not our Senpai. Who exactly are you?!?!,
2441,,*,Where are my manners? I should have introduced myself first. I am Seal.,
2442,,Seal,Thanks to CHAOS FIGURE. We can finally meet in person.,
2443,,KongMing,So it's through the CHAOS FIGURE that you can enter my consciousness…,
2444,,Seal,"That's right, and nothing can ever separate us again~",
2445,,KongMing,You look… Very similar to Senpai.,
2446,,KongMing,…So Senpai is similar to you in essence! If you are the source of CHAOS FIGURE...,
2447,,KongMing,Then Senpai… Senpai will have to be…,
2448,,Seal,"Now, now, let's not continue that line of thought.",
2449,,Seal,"How dangerous… This is the first time we meet, and you're already digging...",
2450,,Seal,I wanted to make you my right-hand man. Things would have been way less complicated that way.,
2451,,Seal,"Now there's no choice, it seems...",
2452,,KongMing,……,
2453,,Seal,"I'm sorry, KongMing.",
2454,,KongMing?,Ughhhhhh……Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!,
2455,,Seal,Go KongMing! Start with those you love the most!,
2456,,Seal,I'll love to see your face after you realized what you have done……,
2457,To Iron Fist (Part I),KongMing,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry… What have I done…",
2458,,KongMing,"It's all my fault, Iron Fist…",
2459,,KongMing,"Wait, what am I doing?",
2460,,KongMing,Iron Fist woke me up. I'm feeling sorry for myself?,
2461,,KongMing,Was this coming from the CHAOS FIGURE… Or was it just me…,
2462,,KongMing,There is no time for this. I need to remember everything I saw. I have to record it.,
2463,,KongMing,I saw…,
2464,,KongMing,"This must be the ""Judgement Day"" Gabriel was talking about.",
2465,,KongMing,"The boarder that differs all the ""Existence"" is erased.",
2466,,KongMing,And the waves of chaos devour everything. This is the end of the world…,
2467,,KongMing,…This is our future?,
2468,,KongMing,"At that moment, my consciousness was completely gone. Everything is fused together into this endless mix",
2469,,KongMing,Until the end of time... Until even eternity would cease to exist……,
2470,,Iron Fist,"No, KongMing senpai!!",
2471,,KongMing,"Iron Fist, it was you that pulled me out of that darkness…",
2472,,KongMing,It was you that brought me back.,
2473,,KongMing,"What I saw wasn't the future, it was just a vision…. No…. It's not even chaos.",
2474,,KongMing,It's not born from chaos but from someone who has been granted awareness of the chaos. Someone who once entered my thoughts…,
2475,,KongMing,……Seal.,
2476,,KongMing,I understand now.,
2477,,KongMing,Yume Academy was found to fight against the forces of chaos and to protect the Gap World…,
2478,,KongMing,It was the first and most important rule of the Academy.,
2479,,KongMing,But it's far from everything!!,
2480,,KongMing,Yume Academy was a heavily-defended military camp...,
2481,,KongMing,built to guard the Chaos Seal.,
2482,,KongMing,"But ultimately, those who fight the monsters become monsters themselves. And the jailers fell prey to the prisoners…",
2483,,KongMing,"While the Chaos Seal was kept intact, Seal became the outlet of chaos.",
2484,,KongMing,"The Chaos Seal worked normally, but it's leaking out and can't be stopped.",
2485,,KongMing,"The CHAOS FIGURE, the Discipline Committee, the D.E.F... They are all cover-ups for something else.",
2486,,KongMing,The true threat hasn't arrived yet...,
2487,,KongMing,"Iron Fist, you must start preparing yourself for what is coming next.",
2488,,KongMing,Don't be afraid…. Just heed my words...,
2489,,KongMing,Chaos…,
2490,,KongMing,All the phantoms that never came into being or have long perished…,
2491,,KongMing,The combination of endless possibilities and what-ifs...,
2492,To Iron Fist (Part II),KongMing,"Whatever happens, Iron Fist, stay with Senpai!",
2493,,KongMing,"A storm looms on the horizon, and Senpai is its eye.",
2494,,KongMing,"Only by staying with Senpai, will you be safe.",
2495,,KongMing,But… Even if this doesn't happen… If Senpai is gone…,
2496,,KongMing,...Unless Michael and Lucifer decide to unite their forces…,
2497,,KongMing,…Don't pick a side!!,
2498,,KongMing,The Discipline Committee and the D.E.F. are all Seal's pawn.,
2499,,KongMing,"Both sides have the same chance of causing massive-scale CHAOS FIGURE explosions, and this time…",
2500,,KongMing,"With the chaos, corruption will become stronger than ever imagined.",
2501,,KongMing,"Once a student is infected, she will join the forces of chaos and attack the Academy.",
2502,,KongMing,Remember to stay away from the Discipline Committee and the D.E.F. Go find your friends…,
2503,,KongMing,…And survive with them!,
2504,,KongMing,The tides will turn…,
2505,,KongMing,"...Only if Senpai peacefully comes back to us. Yes, I know about the D.E.F.'s secret investigation.",
2506,,KongMing,...But I trust Senpai.,
2507,,KongMing,If Senpai returns…,
2508,,KongMing,"Iron Fist, do you still remember the radio station of the academy?",
2509,,Iron Fist,Radio… Station…?,
2510,,KongMing,Don't tell me you forgot about it…,
2511,,Iron Fist,Hehe…,
2512,,KongMing,What can I say…,
2513,,KongMing,Do you remember the maintenance site that I brought you to?,
2514,,KongMing,We were at the landlines of the Radio Station together doing maintenance work.,
2515,,KongMing,The Radio Station has its own independent power source and maintenance system and in fact…,
2516,,KongMing,"…It is the core of the shadow network, don't tell anyone else~",
2517,,KongMing,"Anyways, it's nothing major. Just a reminder.",
2518,,KongMing,Hahahaha…,
2519,,KongMing,"In other words, the situation will be more perilous.",
2520,,KongMing,"But you must be brave… Even if it's just for me, or for everyone that you care about…",
2521,,KongMing,You must hold on until I come back…,
2522,,KongMing,Believe me... I will.,
2523,,KongMing,"By the way, don't forget to send Sapphire her parcel on time.",
2524,Message for Saint,Iron Fist,Saint senpai!,
2525,,Saint,Iron Fist…?,
2526,,Saint,You sure have the guts. How dare you walk up to me like this?,
2527,,Saint,And just when I am looking for a bargaining chip with the Discipline Committee…!,
2528,,Saint,I'm not going to hold back…!!,
2529,,Iron Fist,Here is your parcel!,
2530,,Saint,？？,
2531,,Iron Fist,It's from KongMing senpai!,
2532,,Saint,Oh… So that's why you're here...,
2533,,Iron Fist,Take it! It's important~,
2534,,Saint,"Um, okay… Thanks for delivering it.",
2535,,Iron Fist,No problem! I have to go. Goodbye Saint Senpai~!,
2536,,KongMing,Everything is progressing smoothly: the conflict between the Discipline Committee and the D.E.F. has diverted the attention of the Chaos Legion.,
2537,,KongMing,Even if the storm can't be stopped…,
2538,,KongMing,We can at least keep the damage under control.,
2539,,Saint,"Tch, I always keep my promises!",
2540,,KongMing,"However, the real challenges are yet to come.",
2541,,KongMing,"When the time comes, I hope you can keep our promise.",
2542,,KongMing,…Saint.,
2543,,KongMing,"You wanted to be the ruler of the land, and settle our issues with force.",
2544,,KongMing,I didn't understand what you were going on about. But now… I understand.,
2545,,KongMing,I respect your choices.,
2546,,KongMing,But what happens now is far greater than both of us…,
2547,,KongMing,"When the time comes, we need to unite everyone…",
2548,,KongMing,Or we won't stand a chance…or Senpai won't stand a chance… So please.,
2549,,KongMing,Please convince Lucifer to accept the Discipline Committee's terms!,
2550,,Saint,"Sure, sure… You were always the control freak...",
2551,,Saint,...Always nagging us to do what you wanted.,
2552,,KongMing,"When all of this is over, let's settle the scores!",
2553,,,"After finishing the letter, Saint was silent for a while,",
2554,,,...And then threw it into the stove.,
2555,,,"Watching the piece of paper being burned by the flames and turned into ashes, Saint's expression…",
2556,,,…Was the most serious she ever had.,
2557,,Saint,Tch…,
2558,,Saint,"When the time comes, everything will go according to your plan. Won't it?",
2559,,Saint,You already have the upper hand even when the battle hasn't even started yet…,
2560,To Sapphire (Part I),,I can still recall that night when we first met…,
2561,,,"The night was warm, calm, and intoxicating.",
2562,,,"The falling leaves drift along with the wind, casting a light under the streetlight.",
2563,,,I strolled around... Away from the books... Away from the patients... To cool off my head with the night breeze.,
2564,,,"At this moment, your music flowed into my ears---",
2565,,KongMing,"""Hm? This melody...""",
2566,,,Your music filled the night air. The leaves start to spin and dance to it.,
2567,,,I stood still. I got caught in the moment.,
2568,,,It's a kind of nostalgic feeling that words cannot describe.,
2569,,,"A fuzzy, unclear memory jumps forward, whispering into my ear, and harmonizing with the music.",
2570,,,"I felt that this was a meeting that surpassed time and space, and that...",
2571,,,...In the fragments of my memories… You were there.,
2572,,KongMing,"""Intriguing…""",
2573,,,"You kept silent and looked calmly at me, an uninvited stranger.",
2574,,,Soft and Thin... Like a delicate work of art... That is the impression you make to others.,
2575,,,But the emotions in your music tells another story…,
2576,,,"…They were deep, sophisticated, even sly at times…Truly amazing.",
2577,,,I sat down and started to play a tune.,
2578,,,It popped out of nowhere when I heard your melody...,
2579,,,"That moment and time, we have played it together.",
2580,,,"At that moment, your whole demeanor finally changed.",
2581,,,You were no longer someone who is in a faraway place. You turned into someone else...,
2582,,,You turn into someone who has always been by my side…,
2583,,,I joined the Music Club.,
2584,,,We used to play together... Speaking in notes that only we understood...,
2585,,,...And spent those cold nights together.,
2586,,,It was my most cherished memory...,
2587,To Sapphire (Part II),,But on that autumn night…. Everything has changed.,
2588,,,"On the way to the Music Club,",
2589,,,I was really looking forward to playing music with you again when I heard it...,
2590,,KongMing,"""What is this…?""",
2591,,,I never heard you play anything like this before.,
2592,,,Intense and passionate. Like a battle hymn right before the start of a battle between two armies.,
2593,,,The notes blew me away like a gust of wind.,
2594,,,"The winds were ferocious. And it came with a huge blazing flame, along with warcries and strong beat of drums.",
2595,,,"I shivered as memories rushed out from the darkness, drowning me within and not allowing me to be myself.",
2596,,,Why were my emotions so intense?,
2597,,,Where exactly… Is this Bronze Swallow Terrace?,
2598,,,Who exactly is this Sapphire?,
2599,,Sapphire,"""What's wrong, KongMing?""",
2600,,Sapphire,？,
2601,,KongMing,"""Are we going to play tonight?""",
2602,,Sapphire,……,
2603,,,You were silent and just shook your head.,
2604,,,Are you… Avoiding me?,
2605,,,"Suddenly, a strong urge to fight overcame me.",
2606,,,What is wrong with me? Why do I have this feeling of wanting to hurt… My friend?,
2607,,,Friend??,
2608,,,Sapphire is no friend of mine. She's an enemy.,
2609,,,Enemy…… Wait a minute.,
2610,,,The CHAOS FIGURE is getting stronger and stronger. I'm afraid I don't have much time left.,
2611,,,"I need to finish the report as fast as I can, and think of…",
2612,,,…A way to face that guy…,
2613,Epilogue: The Final Contact,,The parcel have been sent.,
2614,,,"KongMing lets go of her pen, as if she is freeing up a heavy burden.",
2615,,,"She gazed calmly into space in front of her, and the silhouette that gradually materialized itself.",
2616,,KongMing,……You got me.,
2617,,Seal,You're not well-behaved. KongMing.,
2618,,Seal,You make us sad…,
2619,,Seal,Why would you want to leave the CHAOS FIGURE and us?,
2620,,KongMing,HaHa!,
2621,,Seal,But I've got you now~,
2622,,Seal,Come on! Let's go back to our great happy family and play~!,
2623,,KongMing,"Seal, it looks like you haven't understood your situation yet.",
2624,,Seal,……,
2625,,KongMing,I can't leave at all… I don't even know where I am.,
2626,,KongMing,"Come on, take me away~",
2627,,Seal,"Well played, KongMing~! You sacrificed yourself to sabotage my plans.",
2628,,Seal,"I have to admit. Out of the 23 plans that I set for you, none will work in this situation.",
2629,,Seal,However!,
2630,,Seal,Even if you will never be mine...,
2631,,Seal,I will be more than happy to see you struggle… In a scenario where you have no chance to win~!,
2632,,Seal,Despair will eventually devour you whole…,
2633,,Seal,I suppose this will be entertaining? HAHAHAHAHAHAHA….,
2634,,KongMing,"Ha~ Ha… I trust, my friends. They will… Find…",
2635,,KongMing,They will… Find... Find... Uh…. Fdin a ywa…,
2636,,KongMing?,(Senseless murmurs),
2637,To Sapphire (Part III),KongMing,"Sapphire, after that… Many things have happened.",
2638,,KongMing,I realized that you changed that night.,
2639,,KongMing,"And now, so have I...",
2640,,KongMing,"In order to protect you, and everyone who I love… And cherish…",
2641,,KongMing,"I must leave the Academy, and hide somewhere no one will be able to find me.",
2642,,KongMing,Nobody… Except you.,
2643,,KongMing,This recording contains the song that we always played.,
2644,,KongMing,Nobody in the Academy knows this song better than you.,
2645,,KongMing,Please protect this cassette that holds my deepest secrets…,
2646,,KongMing,I trust you understand what I'm thinking about now….,
2647,,KongMing,...And I'll leave the rest to you.,
2648,On That Day,,"On that day, Yume Academy was in chaos.",
2649,,,"After the outbreak of the CHAOS FIGURE, a great disturbance happened at the School Festival.",
2650,,,"A new underground association, D.E.F, assaulted the HQ of Discipline Committee amidst the chaos.",
2651,,,"Discipline Committee, Student Union, all the clubs...the Academy was thrown into chaos.",
2652,,,What's worse...,
2653,,,... Senpai was missing.,
2654,,,Was Senpai the source of Chaos?,
2655,,,"In order to find the source of the Chaos, did Senpai have to enter the Academy's forbidden areas?",
2656,,,Was Senpai truly a mystery?,
2657,,,Whatever the truth was... it doesn't matter anymore.,
2658,,,"After Senpai's disappearance, everyone in Yume Academy seems to no longer trust each other.",
2659,,,Just as if their bonds were cut off.,
2660,,,"Officers of Student Union, Discipline Member, D.E.F. member, and Club Elites...those titles hold no significance anymore.",
2661,,,"They got ambushed, surrounded, infected, or fled...",
2662,,,"No matter which side they picked, it doesn't matter to the infected.",
2663,,Aquaris,(Gasp)... Can't do this any more…,
2664,,Aquaris,Here... it should be here…,
2665,,Aquaris,I need a rest... (Takes a deep breath),
2666,,,……,
2667,,Aquaris,"Well, Sonya's Cafeteria is not far away... Keep fighting Aquaris!",
2668,,Aquaris,Huh?,
2669,,,(Sound of fighting can be heard from afar. This sounds like...),
2670,,Aquaris,"Iron Fist, let me help you!",
2671,,Iron Fist,Wonderful!,
2672,,Iron Fist,"Looks like we'll need to stick together again, Aquaris.",
2673,,Aquaris,"Iron Fist, what's your plan?",
2674,,Iron Fist,"Find survivors and move together! The more teammates we have, the bigger the chance we'll make it…",
2675,,Aquaris,In finding Senpai!,
2676,,Iron Fist,"Yes, in finding senpai, and ... KongMing senpai…",
2677,,Aquaris,"Just wait a minute, it will be quick...",
2678,,Aquaris,"Alright, let's go!",
2679,,Iron Fist,Okay...,
2680,,,"So, Aquaris and Iron Fist searched for survivors on their way scouting to the edge of Academy.",
2681,,,"The farther they move forward, the more survivors they've rescued. The group gradually becomes slower and slower.",
2682,,,"Finally, they were surrounded by the infected...",
2683,,Iron Fist,"Watch out! There are some more... ""things"" coming!",
2684,,Aquaris,There's literally no end to them...,
2685,,*,"Iron Fist, Aquaris, and everyone!",
2686,,*,"Thank god, you're all okay!",
2687,,Iron Fist,Senpai???,
2688,Before Striking Back,,Senpai is back!,
2689,,,"Students built up a strong line of defense in front of the Radio Station, and even the Discipline Committee and the D.E.F. had also joined.",
2690,,,"While sending out squads to search and rescue survivors in Academy, they've also gathered forces.",
2691,,,A strike back is at hand…,
2692,,Michael,"Gabriel, how do we look?",
2693,,Gabriel,"We've made contact with Dracula, House Ghost is still in control. But…",
2694,,Gabriel,House Human has already fallen and is controlled by Chaos Legion. And the one in command…,
2695,,Gabriel,...is Guan Yin.,
2696,,Joan,!?,
2697,,*,"So, even Guan Yin is infected...",
2698,,Gabriel,"According to Michael's assessment, Guan Yin is deeply infected...",
2699,,Gabriel,...with CHAOS FIGURE intensifying her strength. She's already…,
2700,,Lucifer,Now she is standing between us and House Human.,
2701,,Lucifer,We'll need to consider how to…,
2702,,Michael,"Lucifer! Think about the feeling of others, after all…",
2703,,Joan,"Please don't worry about me, President.",
2704,,Joan,"We've faced so many of the infected. If Guan Yin's infection is irreversible, then…",
2705,,Saint,Hey! We are now talking about Guan Yin!!!,
2706,,Joan,"If you cannot accept reality, then I'll do that!!",
2707,,Joan,Guan Yin is deeply infected! And there is no going back!,
2708,,Joan,If she shows hostility... she will become a great threat to both to us or the counterattack operation!,
2709,,Joan,We must take her out!!!,
2710,,*,What if... we still have other options...?,
2711,,Michael,……,
2712,,Gabriel,……,
2713,,Saint,......Tch.,
2714,,Aquaris,"Senpai, and president Michael, I…",
2715,,Michael,？,
2716,,Aquaris,I... volunteer... to fight against House Human…,
2717,,Michael,"Aquaris, think before you act. We need to think of a plan...",
2718,,Aquaris,I've been thinking about this for a long time. And... I'd like to lead the front line in this mission.,
2719,,Joan,"Aquaris, you helped suppressed the infected once before.",
2720,,Aquaris,"Yes. Not long after I join the Discipline Committee, the CHAOS FIGURE appeared.",
2721,,Joan,"I still remember that operation. All your teammates returned safely, but you didn't…",
2722,,Aquaris,"Yes, I... I was lost and then…",
2723,,Joan,Then what?,
2724,,Aquaris,I fell behind...,
2725,,Joan,And what was your score in field combat training?,
2726,,Aquaris,It was a B-minus.,
2727,,Joan,Should I continue? Or…,
2728,,Michael,"Joan, that's enough.",
2729,,Joan,President?,
2730,,Aquaris,……,
2731,,Michael,"Aquaris, you've done very well...",
2732,,Michael,"You and Iron Fist helped Senpai gather survivors. And everyone owes you for that, you've done well enough.",
2733,,Michael,But House Human... That will be a tough battle.,
2734,,Michael,And... we cannot guarantee that we will win.,
2735,,Michael,"So in this case, I think... I will leave the job to someone who is more capable to do it, okay?",
2736,,Aquaris,Okay...,
2737,I must be there.,,"That night, Aquaris snuck out of camp without being noticed.",
2738,,,But soon she realized that she is not alone...,
2739,,Aquaris,Ah... I got lost again.,
2740,,Aquaris,So where am I now…,
2741,,？,"Aquaris, where are you going?",
2742,,Aquaris,How could it be…,
2743,,Aquaris,Why are you here?,
2744,,Iron Fist,There should be someone with you... Aquaris... in case you get lost again.,
2745,,Bud Elf,Finally... you're lucky my friends are around.,
2746,,Bud Elf,Come back... We may still be able to steer clear of the enemies.,
2747,,Aquaris,Please help me…,
2748,,Aquaris,Bring me to Guan Yin…,
2749,,Iron Fist,……,
2750,,Bud Elf,You really want to do this?,
2751,,Aquaris,Yes.,
2752,,Iron Fist,"Guan Yin is the ""Goddess of War"", the best fighter in the Academy. She scored a 98 in Combat Ability...",
2753,,Iron Fist,It's almost suicidal to face her now.,
2754,,Aquaris,I know that... but I have to see her.,
2755,,Iron Fist,There must be a reason for this. Could you tell us about it?,
2756,,Aquaris,……,
2757,,Aquaris,It was that operation against the infected of CHAOS FIGURE…,
2758,,Aquaris,"Damn, they just keep coming... What should I do...? I cannot defeat them all…",
2759,,Aquaris,"Sorry, everyone... I... can't make it…",
2760,,？,"Get down, girl.",
2761,,Aquaris,！？,
2762,,Guan Yin,I'm not even warmed up... Can you still move?,
2763,,Aquaris,Who? Me?,
2764,,Guan Yin,Very well.,
2765,,Aquaris,That's the whole story…,
2766,,Aquaris,"I owe Guan Yin my life. So no matter how small the chance might be, I'm going to do it! Or else...",
2767,,Aquaris,...I will never forgive myself.,
2768,,Iron Fist,……,
2769,,Bud Elf,Let's just help her out.,
2770,,Iron Fist,Okay... I can't just leave her alone.,
2771,,Iron Fist,Bud Elf. Can you help us secretly bypass the Legion of Chaos's blockade?,
2772,,Bud Elf,Let me see...,
2773,,Bud Elf,I can do that.,
2774,,Iron Fist,"So we're going to meet Guan Yin, just to take a glance. Don't make a sound, okay?",
2775,,Aquaris,Okay! Thank you all!,
2776,,Aquaris,Now let's find Guan Yin!,
2777,The furthest distance in the world,Bud Elf,(Whisper) This is it... There's no one else. And Guan Yin is right up ahead…,
2778,,Aquaris,(Whisper) Stay where you are. Let me go see her.,
2779,,Iron Fist,(Whisper) Make it quick. We had a deal. It's just a quick visit…,
2780,,Aquaris,"(Whisper) Okay, got it.",
2781,,Bud Elf,(Whisper) Aquaris... are you really going to do no more than that?,
2782,,Iron Fist,(Whisper) I also have a bad feeling about this…,
2783,,Aquaris,Guan Yin!!,
2784,,Guan Yin?,……,
2785,,Iron Fist,(Whisper) I knew that would happen…,
2786,,Iron Fist,"(Whisper) Bud Elf, get ready to act…",
2787,,Aquaris,(Whisper) Let me take care of this!,
2788,,Aquaris,"(Whisper) Whatever happens, don't come out... Trust me.",
2789,,Guan Yin?,You...,
2790,,Guan Yin?,Invader...,
2791,,Aquaris,As expected... You still don't remember me…,
2792,,Aquaris,Just like that time…,
2793,,,Real Combat Training for Discipline Members,
2794,,,"To improve the combat and survivability of the Discipline Members against the threat of the CHAOS FIGURE, the training was set up.",
2795,,,"Assigned by Michael, Joan invited her best friend as the coach --- Guan Yin, the ""Goddess of War""",
2796,,,"""Guan Yin senpai, look over here"" ""Senpai!""...",
2797,,,It's more like meeting a celebrity than a training program.,
2798,,,"Aquaris was there too. She wanted to get closer, show her gratitude to Guan Yin, and tell her that she'll always support and follow her...",
2799,,Aquaris,Guan Yin senpai! Over here! Look over here~!,
2800,,Guan Yin,Oh?,
2801,,Aquaris,Thank you! Thank you for saving my life that day…!,
2802,,Guan Yin,"Hey, looking good! Keep working at it~!",
2803,,Guan Yin,"Haha, thank you all~! Everybody keep working at it…",
2804,,Aquaris,Guan Yin is everybody's'... Everyone loves her.,
2805,,Aquaris,How could she notice me…,
2806,,Aquaris,...I'm just a nobody?,
2807,,Guan Yin?,......,
2808,,Aquaris,I... (Sighing) I know…,
2809,,Aquaris,I'm just... another fan... that's all...,
2810,,Aquaris,and all I can do... is to look up at you... but…,
2811,,Aquaris,Don't you remember...?,
2812,,Aquaris,The time we spent together in Special Training!!!,
2813,The Negate Scale,Guan Yin,How could I forget again…,
2814,,Guan Yin,...Where is my belt?,
2815,,Guan Yin,There is still someone here? It's so late…,
2816,,Aquaris,(Deep breath)... Thrust! Follow up! Dodge! Then…,
2817,,Aquaris,What's next...?,
2818,,Guan Yin,"After dodging, you should decide to counterattack or parry according to the rhythm of your foe.",
2819,,Guan Yin,"In order to do that, you'll need to understand their fighting styles. That requires extensive experience in actual combat.",
2820,,Aquaris,G.... GUAN YIN SENPAI!!!,
2821,,Aquaris,Why are you here?... It's so late...,
2822,,Guan Yin,Haha~,
2823,,Aquaris,Oh no! She saw everything!!!,
2824,,Aquaris,It's too awkward!!!,
2825,,Guan Yin,Found it. It's here.,
2826,,Aquaris,"SsSSsSenpai, good bye~",
2827,,Guan Yin,"You should go back. Don't train too hard, it will ruin your performance tomorrow~",
2828,,Aquaris,"But my training is not good enough... If I don't try harder, I will be left behind...",
2829,,Guan Yin,...What's your name?,
2830,,Aquaris,"My name is Aquaris, junior of this year~!",
2831,,Guan Yin,Aquaris... I will remember that name.,
2832,,Guan Yin,Come see me after dinner tomorrow. I'll arrange for you some targeted training courses.,
2833,,Guan Yin,Go back home and have a good rest.,
2834,,Aquaris,Special training?.................................................... Okay!,
2835,,Guan Yin,I've told you millions of times before to keep your balance!  Are you a fool??,
2836,,Aquaris,Ahhh!!,
2837,,,Failed... Failed again... Always failing.,
2838,,,"Guan Yin senpai's special training was strict and painful, but it was the best time since enrolling in the Academy.",
2839,,,Targeted training plan... Flexible battle combat styles... and tactical analysis…,
2840,,,"And most importantly, seeing Guan Yin senpai face to face…",
2841,,,It was something that Aquaris didn't even dare to dream about before.,
2842,,Aquaris,I can't do it anymore. Ah---,
2843,,Guan Yin,Baka! I told you so many times. You need to see through the diversion!,
2844,,Aquaris,Be that as it may... But…,
2845,,Aquaris,I cannot... see through... your diversion...,
2846,,Aquaris,I can't tell... I... I'm dying…,
2847,,Guan Yin,"Looks like it was me who has gone too far... Alright, that's it for today's training.",
2848,,Guan Yin,Go take a rest and leave~,
2849,,Aquaris,"Senpai, may I ask you a question?",
2850,,Guan Yin,What is it?,
2851,,Aquaris,Why is it that you always turn your shoulder unnaturally when you are halfway through your Omnislash?,
2852,,Guan Yin,"Yes, and that's for releasing force. Otherwise, the turn around that comes after won't be as smooth.",
2853,,Aquaris,But... won't that become a weak point?,
2854,,Guan Yin,So what?,
2855,,Aquaris,?,
2856,,Guan Yin,No skill is perfect. The balance will always break when you start anything; this is the rule for everything.,
2857,,Guan Yin,"Being afraid of making a mistake, or stubbornly aiming for perfect balance... this will only limit yourself.",
2858,,Guan Yin,"Know yourself, control yourself, and you can control your weaknesses.",
2859,,Guan Yin,"You may then achieve the first step of ""Know thyself"".",
2860,,Guan Yin,"And think about it. Even if there is one weak point in my Omnislash, who will be able to notice it in time?",
2861,,Aquaris,I... I don't understand~,
2862,,Guan Yin,Haha... BAKA~,
2863,,Guan Yin,"You will understand when it is time, trust me!",
2864,,Aquaris,Senpai... Okay!,
2865,,Guan Yin?,……,
2866,,Aquaris,Senpai... I finally... understand...,
2867,,Aquaris,Come on Senpai! Let me show you... the result of my training!,
2868,,Guan Yin?,Ahhhhh!!!!,
2869,,Aquaris,The weak point... there it is!,
2870,,Aquaris,How can it be... there is still the next move?,
2871,,Guan Yin,"You really think... I don't care about that weak point? Didn't see that coming, right Aquaris?",
2872,,Guan Yin,The tactic of delaying the attack...from counterattack to counterattack... It is a tactic that searches for chances of survival when all seems bleak. It requires total calm and courage.,
2873,,Guan Yin,"When using this skill, my inner beast becomes restrained…",
2874,,Guan Yin,You're the first one to push me that far. Looks like the time spent in Special Training wasn't wasted after all~,
2875,,Aquaris,Senpai!!,
2876,,Guan Yin,What's that smell? What did you bring this time?,
2877,,Aquaris,"Senpai, this is the last pork set meal at Yume Academy!",
2878,,Aquaris,"I found it in Sonya's Cafeteria, and saved it for you~",
2879,,Guan Yin,... Let's talk while eating.,
2880,,Aquaris,"Hey, all is clear now!",
2881,,Iron Fist,………………,
2882,,Bud Elf,So...,
2883,,Iron Fist,"Is it Aquaris's special training that woke up the ""Goddess of War""...",
2884,,Bud Elf,Or... it's just because of the food?,
2885,,Aquaris,No more questions! It's the inner beast!,
2886,,Guan Yin,Well...,
2887,Justice Rains,Saint,(Gasp)…,
2888,,Saint,Damn it! It's a dead-end!,
2889,,Saint,Must... find another way out...,
2890,,Saint,！？,
2891,,,Just when Saint decided to find another way...,
2892,,,she was already cornered by a large number of infected with more and more coming.,
2893,,Saint,So many of them!? When did this...,
2894,,Saint,All of them are infected to the core! Damn it! There's no other way...,
2895,,Saint,"It's going to be hard dealing with them, but I don't plan to go down without a fight...",
2896,,？,Justice Rains from above!,
2897,,Saint,What?!,
2898,,,"After the battle, all infected are defeated,",
2899,,,Only the newcomer is left standing in front of Saint--,
2900,,Hexa,Threat neutralized\nCasualty: 0,
2901,,Hexa,Mission accomplished---,
2902,,Saint,"Hexa, I knew you'd come! Thanks for the help.",
2903,,Saint,I didn't really need it. I love how you end the fight like that.,
2904,,Hexa,Justice will be carried out without delay!,
2905,,Saint,Justice? Haha! Whatever makes you feel better...,
2906,,Saint,"Let's find someplace to patch up, then...",
2907,,Hexa,New signal detected---,
2908,,Hexa,--Large infected group detected... 37 infected total... Location...,
2909,,Saint,"Uh... Hexa, let's just rest for a bit?",
2910,,Saint,You've been doing this for 2 days...,
2911,,Hexa,47 hours 36 minutes and 8 seconds to be exact.,
2912,,Saint,"Right, I know that. You haven't rest for almost 48 hours...",
2913,,Hexa,"I know what you mean, Saint.",
2914,,Hexa,But as long as peace in Yume Academy is threatened by something sinister.,
2915,,Hexa,I'll bring them to justice!,
2916,,Saint,"Wait! Hexa, wait!",
2917,,Saint,What a stubborn girl...,
2918,,Saint,Hexa! Hexa!,
2919,,,"Just as Saint, gasping for breath, finally finds Hexa, the battle is already over.",

2924,,Hexa,"Warning, system overload...",
2925,,Hexa,Sorry... Saint...,
2926,,Hexa,I was wrong...,
2927,,Hexa,I... should have... listened to you...,
2928,,Saint,Hexa!!!,
2929,The Lab,Saint,Anyone here?!,
2930,,KongMing,Saint? You shouldn't be here...,
2931,,KongMing,Wait... is that Hexa???,
2932,,KongMing,"NORN, open the lab!",
2933,,NORN,Personnel detected. Chief Researcher KongMing.,

2935,,NORN,Preparations will be complete in 203 seconds.,
2936,,KongMing,"Saint, you promised me that you will take good care of Hexa...",
2937,,KongMing,What are you doing coming here asking for help? What's the matter?,
2938,,Saint,You know her better than I do. She doesn't know when to stop! What was there to do?,
2939,,Saint,"After seeing her passed out, I thought you would be more of a help than a doctor. I didn't think much of it.",
2940,,KongMing,…………,
2941,,KongMing,Enough nonsense. Let's see what's going on.,
2942,,KongMing,"NORN, give our guest temporary access.",
2943,,NORN,"According to the access history, the authorization was granted a minute ago.",
2944,,NORN,"Welcome back to the laboratory, Saint.",
2945,,Saint,………………,
2946,,NORN,"Saint, welcome to the Tech Guild Laboratory. I'm the main AI ""NORN""",
2947,,Saint,"Greetings, NORN...",
2948,,KongMing,You're so nice~ Just kidding! Stop wasting time and follow me!,
2949,,,The Tech Guild Laboratory is the R&D center of the academy. It is also where Hexa was found.,
2950,,,"Although KongMing is the chief researcher for a long time, she did not build this laboratory. There are still many things she doesn't understand.",

2962,,KongMing,Switch to manual mode. Cut off all data connections.,
2963,,NORN,Order confirmed.,
2964,,NORN,"Isolating the lab, NORN going offline.",

2966,,KongMing,"Saint, give me a hand...",
2967,,Saint,I'm not from your lab!?,
2968,,KongMing,So you're not the genius that is stated on your student files?,
2969,,Saint,"Fine, I'll take a look. It's only for Hexa.",
2970,,,7 hours later.,
2971,,KongMing,The status of Hexa's body is great. But her consciousness is in disarray according to the data transmitter...,
2972,,Saint,Doesn't that sound familiar?,
2973,,KongMing,I don't know what you're talking about.,
2974,,Saint,"I mean, look at Hexa's current status!",
2975,,Saint,Doesn't that look like the CHAOS FIGURE?,
2976,,KongMing,"An infected may not be fully clear-headed, but a few infected showed up and are moving about.",
2977,,Saint,"But the exact pathological features of CHAOS FIGURE are still unclear, so your theory is still not concrete yet.",
2978,,KongMing,"You're right. In fact, that's the reason why I ordered Norn to go offline and not record this research.",
2979,,KongMing,I have a hunch that Hexa's situation definitely shouldn't be made public...,
2980,,Saint,That's enough. I understand. Now let's keep going~,
2981,,KongMing,You brought Hexa back and done enough to help me. I really appreciate it. Now leave the rest to me!,
2982,,KongMing,"If you don't return now, that creepy organization you joined will tear this campus apart looking for you!",
2983,,Saint,I'm responsible in helping you and getting to the bottom of this. No need to thank me.,
2984,,Saint,But I did forget the time...,
2985,,KongMing,"Don't worry, I'll take care of this. I'll keep you updated.",
2986,DEFRAGMENT,Announcement,Temporary visitor Saint has left the lab. Authorization Nullified.,
2987,,KongMing,"Now, let me get back to work...",
2988,,,The auxiliary device connected to Hexa is still working... The key sounds echo like music in the small laboratory space.,
2989,,,"KongMing tried all she could in analyzing the data of the file. After a long period of hard-work, she found something...",
2990,,,Images that seem to be the surveillance video of the academy.,
2991,,KongMing,This is Bud Elf's garden... And this is Sonya's Cafeteria...,
2992,,,More and more images flash at a faster pace.,
2993,,KongMing,What is this! How can it be???,
2994,,,"The video was normal at the beginning, but---",
2995,,,Some images seem to be filmed in impossible angles...,
2996,,,And the places it recorded are sometimes off the official records.,
2997,,KongMing,"If I didn't read it wrong, these files and data should be Hexa's memory...",
2998,,KongMing,But why are they so well protected? Was Hexa's coma caused by this?,
2999,,KongMing,"Hexa, I'm not sure but if you've been set up...",
3000,,KongMing,"All I can do is defrag this file. Now, you need to count on yourself...",
3001,Epilogue,KongMing,"Hexa, how was your rest?",
3002,,Hexa,Thanks for your concern. I've had a good sleep.,
3003,,Hexa,"It's 16 hours since the last self-check and maintenance, everything looks fine.",
3004,,KongMing,"Yes, you're in good shape. Your plan for today was to join the squad of Discipline committee...",
3005,,KongMing,Ready knock out some infected?,
3006,,Hexa,... Forget it.,
3007,,KongMing,You're not going? Why?,
3008,,Hexa,Many images start to appear in my memory since I passed out. I believe you helped me recover them.,
3009,,KongMing,"Yes, it should be your memories. You were already passed out when Saint brought you here. I helped decode those files to wake you up.",
3010,,Hexa,…I'm not in them.,
3011,,KongMing,What? What do you mean you're not in them?,
3012,,Hexa,"All those memories include the entire time, location, and all the students in the academy...",
3013,,Hexa,Even Senpai's records look thorough and detailed. But...,
3014,,Hexa,I'm not in any of them. Not even in one frame.,
3015,,KongMing,Hexa...,
3016,,Hexa,Are these really my memories? Why are they encrypted? Who am I?,
3017,,Hexa,I don't know what to do... I don't even know if I truly exist.,
3018,,KongMing,"Then, what about that justice that you're willing to carry out? You're going to give up just like that...?",
3019,,KongMing,And just watch the campus be consumed by chaos?,
3020,,Hexa,"Justice... What is it exactly? Is it to eliminate the enemies, or help others out of trouble?",
3021,,Hexa,Why does justice mean so much for me?,
3022,,Hexa,Why do I have this urge to pursue justice...?,
3023,,Hexa,"I can't say for sure. There could be someone who is behind the scenes, pulling all the strings... And we're a bunch of puppets?",
3024,,Hexa,"KongMing, I'm not sure...",
3025,,KongMing,"Sorry, about your past, I am in no place to give you any suggestions. I'm the kind of person who always looks forward.",
3026,,KongMing,"But if we continue researching this CHAOS FIGURE, maybe we can get closer to these series of events and figure out the truth about this world...",
3027,,KongMing,It's best to take action and look for clues than staying here and ponder over this.,
3028,,text,"After leaving the restroom, Hexa looks different from how she used to be like…",
3029,,Hexa,"Although I'm still in doubt, your suggestion is still acceptable. If you need some samples to research CHAOS FIGURES, I can help you with that~",
3030,,Hexa,"Next time I encounter anyone who is even slightly infected and I can't get rid of its symptoms, I will bring her to you~",

3040,,Ithil,Hmm? There's something closing in from the forest...,
3041,,Ithil,That smell... It's dangerous...!,
3042,,Ithil,A monster? How could it appear in the Academy?,
3043,,Ithil,No time to think... I must take it down first!,
3044,,Ithil,That monster... Turns into a book?,
3045,,Ithil,Well... The change seems to be caused by the immense power infused in it.,
3046,,Ithil,But I'm safe for now. I'm not in danger. It's recovering to normal after I beat it?.,
3047,,Ithil,"Fortunately, these creatures haven't managed to run to other places in the Academy.",

3060,,Valeera,"Ithil, do you still remember my ability?",
3061,,Ithil,"If you can completely understand a part of knowledge, they will be recorded automatically and be converted into books.",
3062,,Valeera,Those books hold more than knowledge: they have a certain type of consciousness.,
3063,,Valeera,"If one holds enough knowledge, it can even transform into other creatures...",
3064,,Ithil,"Just as I predicted, these monsters, are all your books...",
3065,,Ithil,"It's too dangerous. If they got out, other students will be in danger!",

3069,,Valeera,"Yes, exactly... Ithil, please help me!",
3070,,Ithil,This is all we can do now... Let's finish this before things get worse!,
3071,Mark the target,Ithil,That Book Spirit you mentioned... Is it on the top floor? I sense great power leaking out of that place.,
3072,,Valeera,That's right! It just completed the conversion yesterday.,
3073,,Valeera,"Before I had time to put it away, it suddenly went out of control.",
3074,,Valeera,It's much stronger than others. Many of my other books were also transformed into monsters by it.,

3088,Clean up,Ithil,"Valeera, your library is a mess.",
3089,,Ithil,The books are scattered everywhere. Have you ever tried putting them in order? They're even blocking our way.,
3090,,Valeera,Organizing them takes too much time. I'd rather just read more books.,
3091,,Ithil,Then how can you find it if everything is a mess?,
3092,,Valeera,"The Book Spirits are obedient. With just one call, they can tell me where they are~",
3093,,Ithil,Okay... Whatever.,
3094,,Ithil,Come give me a hand. I'll put the books blocking our way on the shelf.,
3095,,Valeera,"Uh... Ithil, your maid soul is acting up again.",
3096,,Ithil,"Okay, now it's all in order... Uh?! The monsters are coming down from the upper floors!",
3097,,Ithil,...,
3098,,Valeera,It turns into a mess again!,
3099,,Ithil,These Book Spirits... It's time to teach them a lesson about respect!,
3100,,Ithil,And... I'll be the teacher!,
3101,,Ithil,(Cough)...,
3102,,Valeera,"(Cough)... Where did all this dust come from, it's so dirty...",
3103,,Ithil,"(Cough)... If you've regularly cleaned the library, it wouldn't have been like this...",
3104,,Valeera,(Cough)... It's too large for me to do that...,
3105,,Ithil,So why did you make it so large?,
3106,,Ithil,"...When this is over, I'll help you clean...",
3107,,Valeera,It will be too hard for you to do that alone...,
3108,,Ithil,"""Helping you"" means you'll also join me.",
3109,,Valeera,What~~? No....,
3110,Perception,Ithil,"It's so noisy... The higher we go, the noisier your books become...",
3111,,Valeera,"Ah, sorry! Ithil, you're so perceptive. They are so noisy...",
3112,,Valeera,"But I know how to fix that. Here, crouch down a bit~",
3113,,Ithil,Uh?!,
3114,,Valeera,Why... Are you avoiding me...?,
3115,,Ithil,Not you! Look behind you!,
3116,,Valeera,Uaaaaagh! Bad boy! You scared me!,
3117,,Ithil,Get behind me... Uh... My head...,
3118,,Valeera,Ithil! Are you okay?!,
3119,,Ithil,Oh.... We can't manage so many... These monsters are the main priority...!,
3120,,Valeera,Wow... That was close...,
3121,,Ithil,Uh... My headache is getting worse... My eye mask is getting useless in this condition...,
3122,,Ithil,Valeera...? What happened? Why are you touching my face?,
3123,,Valeera,"Don't move, Ithil...",
3124,,Ithil,Is it... Less noisy...?,
3125,,Valeera,This is a spell I created to lower your sensory perception. It's quite useful~ Hee hee~,
3126,,Valeera,You can't stand a noisy atmosphere. It took me so long to figure out how to help you~,
3127,,Valeera,"Also, the spell only affects your eye mask. Your ability will still be fully functional once you take it off~",
3128,,Ithil,"I feel better now... Thank you, Valeera.",
3129,,Valeera,Haha~ You can praise me more~,
3130,,Ithil,I'm okay now... Let's keep moving.,
3131,,Ithil,"Don't forget to watch my back, Valeera.",
3132,,Valeera,No problem~!!,
3133,Loneliness,Ithil,But by the way... Isn't the library too big?,
3134,,Ithil,"According to me, the library expands every day, just like a living creature.",
3135,,Ithil,Is it really necessary to put so many books inside?,
3136,,Valeera,"I like to read and learn things a lot, so the book storage gets bigger.",
3137,,Valeera,"Once there isn't enough room for books, I'll just magically expand the library.",
3138,,Valeera,"Plus, when a new book is spawned, I just know the topic...",
3139,,Valeera,"But once I grasp the knowledge inside, I will need to read it over and over...",
3140,,Ithil,But... The purpose of building this library is to let the students read more books.,
3141,,Ithil,"Until now, no other student has been here... It's was just you studying...",
3142,,Ithil,"Ever since you've built the library, I've never seen you walk outside of it...",
3143,,Ithil,Valeera... What exactly are you studying?,
3144,,Valeera,"Ithil, I promise... I didn't do anything bad...",
3145,,Valeera,I'm... I'm just---,
3146,,Ithil,Someone just doesn't want us to continue talking…,
3147,,Ithil,That's the last of them... Valeera? What are you thinking about?,
3148,,Valeera,...Ithil...,
3149,,Valeera,Now... Do you feel lonely?,
3150,,Ithil,...Valeera...?,
3151,,Valeera,"I can always feel the loneliness, Ithil.",
3152,,Valeera,All the time since the war is over...,
3153,,Valeera,"No matter how much I read, this feeling won't disappear...",
3154,Shadows of the Past,Valeera,"After Yume Academy is built, this is the first time we've met...",
3155,,Ithil,...There're still a lot of things left to be done.,
3156,,Valeera,Ithil... You haven't forgotten what happened in the war.. Just like me...,
3157,,Ithil,...How can I forget...!,
3158,,Valeera,Yes...,
3159,,Valeera,"Ithil, I used to believe reading is the most interesting thing in the world.",
3160,,Valeera,"But after meeting you, I found...",
3161,,Valeera,It will be happier to share my experience with you.,
3162,,Valeera,"Without you, I couldn't have so many friends in the United Force.",
3163,,Valeera,"But, most of them are... Long gone...",
3164,,Ithil,"Stop it, Valeera...",
3165,,Valeera,I'm really afraid... That someday you will leave me too...,
3166,,Valeera,"Thus I refuse to know more students... Some day, they will all graduate...",
3167,,Valeera,All I can do is to stay inside this library...,
3168,,Valeera,"Ithil... The Chaos will return, sooner or later...",
3169,,Valeera,"Maybe, I will also be killed in the next invasion, and perish...",
3170,,Ithil,"Get to the higher ground, the floor is falling!",
3171,,Ithil,Valeera! Watch out!,
3172,,Ithil,"(Gasp)... Valeera, are you alright...?",
3173,,Valeera,Ithil... You got hurt...,
3174,,Valeera,"(Sob)... Sorry, it's all my fault...",
3175,,Ithil,It's just a scratch. Don't worry. As long as you're fine...,
3176,,Ithil,Let's go. Only a few more steps to the top. Don't think too much about it.,
3177,,Ithil,"Come, give me a hand. I just need a deep breath... We'll keep moving.",
3178,,Ithil,Just get this over with quickly. There's still some cleaning to do.,
3179,,Valeera,(Sob)... Okay...,
3180,Top Floor,Ithil,"Finally, we reached the top floor! But...",
3181,,Valeera,I never thought there would be so many books... The bookshelf is like a maze...,
3182,,Ithil,Eh... This Book Spirit sure knows how to build defensive system...,
3183,,Ithil,"But it okay, I can feel its location. Let's move.",
3184,,Valeera,Ithil! You're wounded. Just leave them to me...,
3185,,Ithil,Don't worry. I'm fine.,
3186,,Ithil,Just do your job and watch my back. The enemies are getting stronger and stronger. But they are no match for us.,
3187,,Ithil,Unleash the power of the Valkyries!,
3188,,Valeera,Okay...! I'll show you what I got~!,
3189,,Ithil,The strongest Book Spirit is near.,
3190,,Valeera,"Ithil, leave it to me.",
3191,,Valeera,I'll finish what I started!,
3192,,Ithil,"...Alright, but watch out. I will act once you're in danger!",
3193,,Valeera,"Thanks! But, don't underestimate me!",
3194,Danger,Ithil,So that's what the strongest Book Spirit looks like...,
3195,,Ithil,Summoning so many monsters to protect itself like that... It's just too powerful. It's too dangerous!,
3196,,Ithil,This is not an enemy we can go easy with... Better take off my eye mask...!,
3197,,Ithil,"Though this place is still noisy, I don't have any other choice...!",
3198,,Ithil,"Valeera, stop the little ones!",
3199,,Ithil,"With them getting distracted, I'll destroy that book in no time!",
3200,,Valeera,Ithil! Don't do it!,
3201,,Valeera,This is the only Book Spirit I won't allow you to destroy!,
3202,,Valeera,"Please, I'm begging you. Stick to the original plan! Hold off the little monsters. Let me deal with this one!",
3203,,Ithil,...! Valeera...,
3204,,Ithil,"...Fine, just do what you want!",
3205,Valeera's Research,Ithil,That's the last of them...,
3206,,Ithil,"Valeera, finish this!",
3207,,Ithil,Valeera! Do it now! It's going to summon new monsters if you keep wasting time!,
3208,,Valeera,"I know... But I need time to prepare. Otherwise, we might fail...!",
3209,,Valeera,The research has just begun... I cannot ruin it~,
3210,,Valeera,Bad child! Behave!,
3211,,Valeera,You're the only one left. Return to your original form!!,
3212,,Ithil,...It's over...,
3213,,Valeera,Finally... Haha~,
3214,,Ithil,Valeera! Are you alright!?,
3215,,Valeera,I'm okay now... Just a little bit tired... Haha..,
3216,,Valeera,Let me rest a bit... Guess I can escape the clean-up job...,
3217,,Ithil,"Forget it, just have a good rest... Huh?",
3218,,Ithil,The book...,
3219,,Ithil,"""Primary research on Philosopher's Stone""... Valeera, did you..!",
3220,,Valeera,"Yes... Ithil, just as you thought... I have to study it...",
3221,,Valeera,"We all know how the legend. Its power, is beyond anything that we could comprehend...",
3222,,Valeera,The Book Spirit has proved it. Even just the information on it can be so destructive...,
3223,,Valeera,"Only by figuring out everything, can we know... The last stand... What happened on the day of total annihilation...",
3224,,Valeera,"And, if possible, the Philosopher's Stone... Might be the key to bring everyone back...",
3225,,Valeera,"Ithil, are you listening?",
3226,,Ithil,...You take a good rest.,

3847,,Esau,"Okay, so it's also time we should move... Uh...!",
3848,,Jacob,"Ah! Watch out...! Your headache is becoming more serious, we'd better visit the hospital...",
3849,,Esau,"Okay, I 'll do that.",
3850,,Esau,"But, this could just be a lack of sleep...",
3851,,Jacob,Sister... I'm still worried...,
3852,,Esau,"I understand, Jacob...",
3853,,Esau,"The Chaos creature inside you, it's the X-Factor.",
3854,,Jacob,I think... I should tell them that...,
3855,,Esau,"If they know that, they will surely kill you.",
3856,,Esau,Not everyone is as kind as Ithil.,
3857,,Jacob,But...,
3858,,Esau,"No buts, Jacob. As long as my seal still exists, Dire won't be a threat.",
3859,,Esau,We're both Valkyries. And I'm assured we'll live a happy life after this is all over.,
3860,,Jacob,"...I understand... Whatever you say, sister...",

3865,,Jacob,Sister... They are everywhere...!,

3895,,Dire,Do you think the seal is made without paying a price?,
3896,,Dire,She's using her angel powers to keep it running. The power is a part of her life.,

3928,,Jacob,I don't want you die...,
3929,,Jacob,"I will take the angel's power from you, so you won't be able to use it!",
3930,,Jacob,After that... You will be fine…,
3931,,Jacob,This... Can only be done by a demon... Can only be done by me!,
3932,,Dire,That's right... Jacob!,
3933,,Esau,I was right... You're still manipulating Jacob!,
3934,,Dire,Manipulate? I'm just showing her a path to salvation.,

3938,,Jacob,Sorry... I can't...!,
3939,,Esau,Uah!,
3940,,Jacob,The angel's power was taken by me...,
3941,,Dire,"Well done! Now, your sister is saved.",
3942,,Jacob,Now keep your promise and leave my body. Or...,
3943,,Dire,Not so fast. I just have one thing left to do...,
3944,,Jacob,What? Ahhh----!,
3945,,Dire,Hehe... Killing your own friend... Hurting your own blood...,
3946,,Dire,"After committing such crimes, your heart will definitely be corrupted!",
3947,,Dire,"As I predicted, the dark power inside you is getting stronger, and is comparable to your sister!",
3948,,Dire,Once the light and dark opposes each other... The Philosopher's Stone will emerge!,
3949,,Jacob,You…You planned this all along...!,
3950,,Dire,Hehe... Nobody can stop me now...,
3951,,Dire,"Soon, my plans will come into fruition!",
3952,,Jacob,No... At least I can stop you...,
3953,,Dire,!!! How did you suppress me...!,
3954,,Jacob,This is my body... Remember that!,
3955,,Jacob,"Come, I will finish what I started... I'll bring you down with me!",
3956,,Jacob,"I'm sorry, sister... Farewell---",
3957,,Esau,Jacob!-----,
3958,,Jacob,Sister? What have you done?,
3959,,Esau,"I took back what was mine--- The angel power, and my sister...",
3960,,Esau,"You will never walk alone, Jacob.",
3961,,Esau,Even if it means my death.,

3976,,Scout B,So it seems.,
3977,,Scout A,Then... should we fall back? I think we'd better leave the rest of the job to the combat units.,
3978,,Scout A,It's been a couple of days since we set off for this mission. I could use some rest~,
3979,,Scout B,"Hold up, we're not leaving just yet.",
3980,,Scout A,Is there anything else we should do?,
3981,,Scout B,Looks like you've totally forgotten your training.,
3982,,Scout B,Our job is not just confirming the enemy's location. We should also record enemy numbers and the position of their encampment and surrounding terrain.,
3983,,Scout B,We need to provide our allies with more detailed information and accurate coordinates.,
3984,,Scout A,"Since we were trained by Ithil, I was too afraid to pay attention during the training sessions.",
3985,,Scout A,"But, if we were like her, we wouldn't have to go through all this trouble.",
3986,,Scout B,"Alright, rest time is over. Let's finish our job.",
3987,,Scout A,Aye aye~,
3988,,Scout A,... I never imagined there would be two additional hideouts for these Chaos Creatures.,
3989,,Scout A,"If the battle group arrives without this intel, they might be overwhelmed. We must avoid that.",
3990,,Scout B,I believe you now understand why we need to collect detailed intel...,
3991,,Scout A,"Yes, I understand...Wait, what's that?",
3992,,Chaos Creature,Waaaaaagh!,
3993,,Scout B,It's a Chaos Creature! We've been spotted!,
3994,,Scout A,Bad timing... We have to fight our way out!,
3995,,Scout A,Damn... There's too many of them...,
3996,,Scout B,"... There's no other option. You go first, I'll cover you.",
3997,,Scout A,...,
3998,,Scout B,"Don't argue with me. I'm stronger than you, so I can buy you more time.",
3999,,Scout B,"Remember, this mission is bigger than us!",
4000,,Scout A,... Understood. Good luck.,
4001,,？？？,You've done well. Seem my training has proven to be effective.,
4002,,,A glint of silver blinked in the darkness.,
4003,,Scout B,It's...,
4004,,Scout A,Captain Ithil!,
4005,,Ithil,Become a beacon of light in the darkness and guide our followers to a bright path. This is what we do.,
4006,,Ithil,You've done very well. Now leave the rest to me.,
4007,,,"With each shiv thrown, Ithil slew an enemy with deadly precision.",
4008,,,The brilliance of the moonlight reflected off the surface of her blades.,
4009,,Ithil,... That's the last of them. Let's go before it's too late.,
4010,,Scout A&B,Copy that!,
4011,,,Suffice it to just say that Ithil gained another pair of crazy fans.,
4012,The Magic of Compassion,Scout A,And that's all happened in a single day.,
4013,,Scout C,Amazing! You're so lucky! I wish I could see how Ithil fights up close~,
4014,,Scout B,"Actually, she moves just like she did during training.",
4015,,Scout C,No way! Ithil would be calmer during training to keep us safe.,
4016,,Scout B,I'm serious! I saw it with my own eyes.,
4017,,Scout C,Are you trying to show off again?,
4018,,Scout B,"No, really, I'm telling the truth...",
4019,,Ithil,What are you all about? May I join your discussion?,
4020,,Scout C,"Oh, Cap. It's nothing, we were just talking about our training.",
4021,,Ithil,"That's good, but it's as they say: ""practice makes perfect"". You won't improve through talking. How about you fight me?",
4022,,Scout A,"Oh, Captain, don't bother yourself with us! We'll find somewhere else and practice ourselves!",
4023,,Scout C,(deep breath)... That was scary. I didn't even realize she was there until she spoke.,
4024,,Scout B,"After all, the Captain is an expert in scouting and stealth.",
4025,,Scout A,"I don't know if you noticed, but it seems that Captain is not in a great mood. Do you think she heard us?",
4026,,Scout B,I'm sure she did…but she will only feel worse when we interrupt her cleaning.,
4027,,Scout A,Cleaning?,
4028,,Scout B,Just look over there.,
4029,,Ithil,(It's really noisy out here today.),
4030,,Ithil,(One of the shortcomings of my acute hearing.),
4031,,Ithil,(Better not to think too much and just continue working. Only concentration can relieve this headache.),
4032,,Ithil,(Dressing like this is more like a part of the ritual to reduce my pressure...),
4033,,Scout A,That's how she relaxes herself.,
4034,,Scout B,"Yeah, leave her alone... Wait, how did she get there?",
4035,,Valeera,(reading) Hmmm...,
4036,,Ithil,This place still needs to be cleaned up...,
4037,,Valeera,(reading) So it's like this...,
4038,,Scout B,Watch out! Get out of the way!,
4039,,Ithil,Ouch!,
4040,,Valeera,(reading)... Ah-ha!,
4041,,Ithil,"What are you doing here?!... Oh, you're fine.",
4042,,Valeera,I'm fine. Can you help me find my book? I need to write down a question so I don't forget...,
4043,,Ithil,Here you are. Looks like it contains some in-depth notes…,
4044,,Valeera,"Oh, do you understand it?",
4045,,Ithil,Just making conversation. It's about the research on energy flow in the air? I've been able to sense such things in the past.,
4046,,Valeera,What!? You can sense such delicate movements? I'd like to research that!,
4047,,Valeera,"Wait, what did I want to take note of again...? Oh no, I've forgotten!",
4048,,Ithil,"Since everything has been handled, I'm getting back to work.",
4049,,Valeera,Wait! At least let me try this spell on you.,
4050,,Ithil,Huh? Why? Is there something strange on my eye-mask?,
4051,,Valeera,"For someone who has keen hearing, nighttime noises must be torture. Being able to perceive such small energy transmissions must be even more painful.",
4052,,Valeera,So I figured out a way to dull your senses…but it doesn't seem to be working well.,
4053,,Valeera,"Don't worry, I will improve my spell in the future.",
4054,,Ithil,...My name is Ithil. You are...?,
4055,,Valeera,"Oh, I must have forgotten to introduce myself. Just call me Valeera!",
4056,,Ithil,Valeera... I'll remember this name.,
4057,,Ithil,"She's a really strange person. Negligent in daily life, but observant in some cases.",
4058,,Ithil,"A spell to lower my perception…maybe I will need that later, but not now.",
4059,Future Plans,,97th Year of the Chaos Calendar. Yume and its United Force are winning the war against Chaos.,
4060,,,The efforts of the Valkyries have been crucial towards their victory.,
4061,,,"But, some still worried about the situation.",
4062,,Valeera,Hmm…interesting…,
4063,,Ithil,"Valeera, what's wrong? Looks like you are thinking about something. Well…maybe I'm over-reacting. You're always like this.",
4064,,Valeera,I'm not always like this! I was just thinking of something~,
4065,,Ithil,"So what are you thinking about, Einstein?",
4066,,Valeera,"Well…since we have the advantage, everyone thinks we're winning, right?",
4067,,Ithil,That's right.,
4068,,Valeera,I was just wondering about how we gained that advantage.,
4069,,Ithil,"Though the Legion of Chaos bests us in numbers and strength, their tactics are somewhat lacking.",
4070,,Ithil,"Because of this, their attacks can be easily stopped and countered with strategy and guerrilla warfare.",
4071,,Valeera,"Well, that makes sense, but I was thinking there might be another reason.",
4072,,Valeera,"If memory serves, the Legion of Chaos was way harder to defeat in the past...",
4073,,Valeera,It's as if…our enemy has totally changed since the last volcanic eruption.,
4074,,Ithil,"...That eruption was certainly big, but how is it related to a change in the Chaos Creatures?",
4075,,Valeera,That's what I was wondering…,
4076,,Ithil,Valeera…thinking about this will not help in battle. We'd better hold that thought until the war is over.,
4077,,Valeera,"Well... I agree. Let's discuss something else, Ithil. Can you tell me what you plan to do after the war is over?",
4078,,Ithil,...I actually haven't thought of this in detail.,
4079,,Valeera,"Well, just let me know what you're thinking when you start to think of it!",
4080,,Ithil,"Haha, sure...Maybe I will go on a journey.",
4081,,Valeera,Oh really?,
4082,,Ithil,"That's right. I've spent almost my entire life on the battlefield, so I'd like to see the world when it's at peace.",
4083,,Ithil,"Maybe a hidden place, silent enough to let me have a full night's sleep.",
4084,,Valeera,"Huh, doesn't really seem like you.",
4085,,Ithil,"Well, what about you?",
4086,,Valeera,Me? I want to build a library with countless books and make it my home.,
4087,,Valeera,"I can read myself to sleep and continue reading when I wake up. For me, that's paradise! Maybe you should join me, since libraries are also silent places.",
4088,,Ithil,I don't know. Libraries are difficult to keep clean.,
4089,,Valeera,True...,
4090,,Valeera,"But maybe after the war, I will be able to refine my spell and successfully dull your senses. Then you'll be free from doing housework for therapy!",
4091,,Ithil,……,
4092,,Valeera,What do you think?,
4093,,Ithil,... I think it's time for us to head out.,
4094,,Valeera,"If I remember correctly, our orders were to group up with Esau and Jacob.",
4095,,Ithil,"That's right, so let's not keep the twins waiting.",
4096,Strange Vibrations,Ithil,This is harder than I thought.,
4097,,Valeera,I think this is why the mission requires a four Valkyrie squad.,
4098,,Jacob,I didn't realize there was a Chaos Creature hideout here...,
4099,,Esau,"But it should be the only one in this area. If we take it out, the area will be secured.",
4100,,Ithil,"True, but just in case, I will scout the terrain. You can follow me and cover my six.",
4101,,Esau,"Alright, leave the job to us!",
4102,,Ithil,（……）,
4103,,Ithil,(Is this my senses failing me?),
4104,,Ithil,"(All my sense are telling me that Chaos Creatures are nearby…but the further I'm from my teammates, the fainter this feeling gets.)",
4105,,Ithil,(Is that...),
4106,,Chaos Creature,Waaaaaagh!,
4107,,Ithil,(Better take care of this one first.),
4108,,Ithil,Done. Looks like there's one hideout here. The threat has been eliminated.,
4109,,Ithil,Leave the rest to the combat unit.,
4110,,Jacob,"You should be the captain of Scout Unit, Ithil...",
4111,,Esau,But I thought Scout Unit doesn't have such experienced fighters...,
4112,,Ithil,"That's not true. We also operate surgical strikes. You know, we are the only ones capable enough to infiltrate enemy territory.",
4113,,Esau,I see...,
4114,,Valeera,I knew this would be an easy job. Now let's head back to base! I've got many books to read.,
4115,,Ithil,(The feeling I had...),
4116,,Ithil,(Was that Esau or Jacob? Both of them...?),
4117,,Jacob,……,
4118,,Ithil,"Jacob, could you please come with me?",
4119,,Jacob,Okay...?,
4120,A Hidden Threat,Jacob,What is it?,
4121,,Ithil,(I was right…the presence of Chaos comes from Jacob),
4122,,Ithil,"Be straight with me. Who are you…or, what's hiding inside you?",
4123,,Jacob,……,
4124,,Jacob,I knew this couldn't be hidden from you during this mission.,
4125,,Jacob,"There's something evil locked inside my body, and it drove me to do something horrible...",
4126,,Jacob,"But thanks to my sister, it no longer has that kind of influence on me.",
4127,,Ithil,Is that so? It still seems very risky to me. I say we better take that evil out once and for all.,
4128,,Jacob,"Ithil... killing me is not a valid option. I once tried to bring it down with me, but I'm not sure if it will help.",
4129,,Jacob,Just think of it. We've taken the advantage because of the leader of Chaos is absent.,
4130,,Jacob,"If we release it once more, it will recover its command of the Legion of Chaos...",
4131,,Ithil,……,
4132,,Jacob,"But if we keep it inside me, the risk is lower. My sister and I will be the last line of defense.",
4133,,Jacob,"The war is almost over, so please...",
4134,,Ithil,Ah... Fine.,
4135,,Jacob,！,
4136,,Ithil,You might be right.,
4137,,Ithil,Let's talk about this after the war is over.,
4138,,Jacob,"Thank you, Ithil...",
4139,,Ithil,Now let's return before they start to worry.,
4140,,Jacob,... Okay.,

4147,,Valeera,"Finally, the day has come!",

4189,,Ithil,I've known...,
4190,,Ithil,…Has all our effort been in vain?,
4191,,Ithil,How could it go so wrong...?,
4192,,Kratos,Do you know of this valley?,
4193,,Kratos,It used to be known as the Monument of Boundaries.,
4194,,Ithil,Is this because I ignored the information given by Kratos?,
4195,,Turin,Don't engage!,
4196,,Turin,It's a trap.,
4197,,Ithil,Is that because I didn't pay attention to Turin's warning?,
4198,,Jacob,"But if we keep it inside me, the risk is lower. My sister and I will be the last line of defense.",
4199,,Jacob,"The war is almost over, so please...",
4200,,Ithil,Is this because I showed sympathy to Jacob?,
4201,,Ithil,………………,
4202,,Ithil,We did nothing wrong…and yet why are we suffering?,
4203,The New Era,？？？,Ithil...,
4204,,Ithil,Who is that?,
4205,,？？？,"Calm down. I am your creator, the order of this world. You may call me ""Li"".",
4206,,Ithil,So you are the one who created this tragedy.,
4207,,Li,"I cannot deny that, but all this is necessary for the greater good. You should understand this.",
4208,,Ithil,……,
4209,,Li,"Sure, Yume has been seriously damaged, but there is still a chance to rebuild...",
4210,,Ithil,But the ones who have already died...,
4211,,Li,"I cannot bring them back. Even if I could reform their bodies, they would contain different souls.",
4212,,Ithil,I see. I can't believe you can do any good.,
4213,,Li,"Ithil, you will assist the new Supervisor to rebuild Yume and become its new leader to prepare for future dangers.",
4214,,Ithil,You seem confident that I will take your offer.,
4215,,Li,I find no reason for you to refuse.,
4216,,Ithil,……,
4217,,Scout A,I still remember what they taught us. We are all dim lights…and it will take more than us to build up a new era.,
4218,,Scout A,Captain Ithil...I've followed you up to this point. I don't regret my choice.,
4219,,Ithil,……,
4220,,Ithil,Of course I won't. But a warning to you: I'm not the kind of person who will be pulled by your strings like a puppet.,
4221,,Li,"Of course not. Since we've made our deal, the rebuilding program will be activated soon. You will become a part of it.",
4222,,Ithil,I hate this conversation...,
4223,,Valeera,Ithil... Ithil...!?,
4224,,Ithil,Valeera...,
4225,,Valeera,Is there anything wrong? You weren't reacting to anything in the last minute.,
4226,,Ithil,... It's nothing.,
4227,,Valeera,But…what should we do now?,
4228,,Valeera,Everyone's…gone...,
4229,,Ithil,……,
4230,,Ithil,Valeera…don't waste too much time in mourning the past. What we should do now is to create a new future for the ones who are still alive.,
4231,,Ithil,(I will not let this sacrifice be wasted...I'll save all of you.),
4232,,,We don't know if this is the last time sunlight will shine on the world.,
4233,,,"But under the cover of moonlight, a new era has arrived.",
4234,A Long Journey,,14th Year of the New Calendar. Yume Academy has been in operation for 6 years.,
4235,,Ithil,"(Cough)…Just as I expected, it's a mess up here.",
4236,,Valeera,Ithil? Are you here for me?,
4237,,Ithil,I'm here to say goodbye.,
4238,,Valeera,Huh? This is unexpected.,
4239,,Ithil,"It's about time. The Academy is now fully functional, so it won't be necessary for me to stay here.",
4240,,Ithil,"I don't agree with Li's methods for maintaining the Academy's operation…but I have to admit, those measures needed to be taken.",
4241,,Ithil,"Still, I feel sorry for them.",
4242,,Valeera,So…where will you go?,
4243,,Ithil,Somewhere I can prepare myself for whatever danger the future holds.,
4244,,Ithil,We know almost nothing outside the Academy. The war made me realize we have much to learn.,
4245,,Ithil,I believe the world outside the Academy will have dangers we must know about and answers that we need.,
4246,,Valeera,But… why should you be the one to go?,
4247,,Ithil,"Though Sivney has already left for the same reason, I don't believe she will be as focused.",
4248,,Ithil,The Supervisor and the students at the Academy are also not ready for this. It can only be me.,
4249,,Ithil,I've done everything I need to. It's time for me to leave.,
4250,,Valeera,Ithil… when will you return?,
4251,,Ithil,"I don't know. If I'm lucky, it will be a few years… but if the world is bigger than I suspect, it might take decades.",
4252,,Ithil,(giggles),
4253,,Valeera,What?,
4254,,Ithil,Do you remember? We used to talk about what we would do once the war ended.,
4255,,Valeera,I said I want to live in a library full of books.,
4256,,Ithil,And I wished to travel… I never thought our dreams would come true in this way.,
4257,,Ithil,"I suspect I'm not going somewhere quiet and safe, but somewhere noisy and dangerous.",
4258,,Valeera,"Before I forget, I optimized the spell to dull your perception. Let me cast it on you one more time.",
4259,,Ithil,Don't bother. My power will useful during my journey. I can handle its side-effects.,
4260,,Ithil,"Maybe when everything is over, you can use the spell on me during my rest.",
4261,,Valeera,Alright...,
4262,,Ithil,"Goodbye, Valeera.",

4267,,Ithil,The Chaos has started to appear again. Something must have happened.,
4268,,Ithil,The barricade that protects the Academy is also failing... Li must have reached his limit.,
4269,,Ithil,At least the Academy is not in Chaos. Our supervisor must be a vigilant one.,
4270,,Ithil,Looks like I'm back right on time...,

4300,,,The sun peeps through the entrance of the cave and is slowly swallowed by the depths. A young girl awakens.,
4301,,？？？,Errrghhh (stretches),
4302,,,It seems the young girl has had a good night's rest. The crystal at the end of her tail turned a shade of warmth.,
4303,,,She gazed towards the entrance of the cave.,
4304,,,"As the night had passed, the entrance had attracted many chaos creatures as usual.",

999999,,,aaa,
4306,,,"With the flick of her finger and the sound of a crystal burst, the chaos creatures dissolved into thin air.",
4307,,,The young girl peeped outside the cave and observed her surroundings.,
4308,,,A breezy sandstorm stirred with crystal fragments swept across the landscape. The ground is covered in crystals and diamonds.,
4309,,,The landscape shimmers a dazzling white.,
4310,,,Outlanders deem this place: The Dewy White Desert -- God's forsaken land of treasure.,
4311,,,"Of course, the locals that had been here for generations might not regard the desert minerals as treasures or even wonder about its origins.",

4313,,,But… she didn't seem to know where she should go.,
4314,,,The endless wandering in this desert has made her forgotten where she came from and where she's heading.,
4315,,？？？,…………,
4316,,？？？,"(Unconsciously, she looked again at the crystal at the end of her tail)",
4317,,,The light darting within the crystal created a reflection of herself on the surface of the crystal.,

4319,,Krystal,My name is Krystal and I will continue to live through this day.,
4320,The Young Girl and Her Tail,,Clusters of crystal fragments formed a part of the desert landscape.,
4321,,,"The sun energy gathered by the crystal had attracted many energy-hungry creatures, such as the chaos creatures.",
4322,,Krystal,This one seems good… Let me try and hunt some too…,
4323,,Krystal,The energy must be plentiful. There are plenty of chaos creatures here. One of them is even about to evolve…,
4324,,Krystal,Cannot let that happen!,
4325,,,"The young girl sat barefoot on the edge of a crystal cluster, her tail digging into the cracks, wriggling and searching.",
4326,,Krystal,"Hehe, just my luck!",
4327,,,"Upon discovery of a rich source of energy, Krystal's tail started swishing with excitement.",
4328,,Krystal,Wah! Thank the Gods! I haven't indulged this much in awhile.,
4329,,Krystal,I hope that some day I get to live well fed and well rested everyday!,
4330,,,She closed her eyes as the energy source turned into an orb of glowing light and floated across from the crystal cluster into the crystal at the end of her tail.,
4331,,,The light in the crystal cluster that once shined brilliantly instantly faded to a dull glow.,
4332,,,"Just before it lost its light, the young girl opened her eyes, ceasing absorption.",
4333,,Krystal,Thanks for the energy.,
4334,,Krystal,"But I need to get going, unfortunately I can't stay here forever…",
4335,,,The young girl gently patted the crystal cluster and continued on her way.,
4336,,,……,
4337,,,"As night fell, she waved her hand and a cave made of hard crystal rose from the air. At the mouth of the cave, she set a piece of high purity crystal in place.",
4338,,,So the hungry chaos creatures can be distracted without noticing Krystal sleeping within.,

4359,,Krystal,What is… family?,
4360,,,"In her short memory, she did not recall any family.",
4361,,,Realizing the young girl's expression the mother didn't know what to say…,
4362,,Young Boy,I know! I know!,
4363,,Young Boy,"(Tugging and pointing at his mother) Mama, is my family!",
4364,,Krystal,(Mimicking the young boy's actions),
4365,,Krystal,"(Tugging and looking into the mother's eyes) Mama, is family?",
4366,,Mother with Glasses,(Blushing red) Uh… Well…,
4367,,Mother with Glasses,(With sudden excitement and hugging Krystal) Of course!,
4368,,Mother with Glasses,"(Poor girl, must've lost her family at a young age……)",
4369,,Krystal,Family… there's a sort of warmth to it…,
4370,,Mother with Glasses,"If you don't mind, treat this as your own home and treat us as your family!",
4371,,Krystal,Really? Can I?,
4372,,Mother with Glasses,"Yes, of course! You are my daughter and I am your mother!",
4373,,Krystal,I… am your daughter and you… are my mother?,
4374,,Mother with Glasses,Yes! (Holding Krystal and the young boy's hands) You are his sister and he is your brother. We are a family!,
4375,,Krystal,(Holding the young boy's hand) I… am your sister and you are my little brother?,
4376,,Young Boy,Yay!! Brother recently left to a faraway place and now I have a sister to play with me!,
4377,,Mother with Glasses,Treat your sister with manners!,
4378,,Krystal,"(Chuckles) No worries, because… we're a family?",
4379,,Mother with Glasses,"(Hugging Krystal and the boy) That's right, we're a family…",
4380,,,Suddenly the mood was interrupted by sounds of people shouting.,
4381,,Panicked Voices,It's them! They're attacking again!,
4382,,Assertive Voice,Quick! Move quickly! This is not a drill!,
4383,,Assertive Voice,"Women and children, find a place to hide. Men, grab your weapons and follow me!",
4384,,Krystal,Could they be…?,
4385,,Mother with Glasses,"Don't be afraid my children, come with me, let's find a place to hide.",
4386,,,"Upon hearing the noise, Krystal got dressed immediately and opened the door.",
4387,,Krystal,"I'm fine, mama…",
4388,,Krystal,(Telling her brother) You and mama have to find a safe place to hide! I'll be right back!,
4389,,,"Before they could react, Krystal ran outside.",
4390,,,A crowd of villagers holding different weapons stood in attack position.,
4391,,,Across from them were chaos creatures.,
4392,,Big Beard,Why is there a girl here?,
4393,,Big Beard,These are not ordinary beasts. It's too dangerous for you to be here! Find a place to hide!,
4394,,Krystal,(Heading towards the creatures) Let us take care of them.,
4395,,Big Beard,(Cautiously watching the creatures while waving his hand to stop Krystal),
4396,,Big Beard,"The battle field is one of bloodshed, I'm won't allow any women and children to die in vain before me!",
4397,,Krystal,(Stops and hesitates),

4401,Big Beard,,"On one sunny afternoon, the mother took her son and Krystal out for a stroll through the village.",

4403,,Mother with Glasses,"When there's usually danger in the village, we'd look for the shopkeeper. You might have met him this morning.",

4405,,Young Boy,Let me show you!,
4406,,Krystal,"(Getting dragged) Well, okay…",
4407,,Young Boy,"(Tiptoeing and pointing at a sword) I spotted this sword awhile ago, isn't it cool!",
4408,,Krystal,It looks sharp!,
4409,,Krystal,(I don't know much about swords),

4413,,Assertive Voice,What's wrong with that?,
4414,,Big Beard,"(Appears suddenly) Well, if it isn't our litte warrior. Have faith, train hard and you'll soon be an adult!",
4415,,Big Beard,(Patting his own strong arms) But you need to train first until you're like me. You've still got a long way to go.,
4416,,Young Boy,Hmm… I'll continue to train hard!,
4417,,Big Beard,Could this be... the mage from this morning?,
4418,,Big Beard,"(Witnessing this mage in battle this morning, I knew I'm no match for her)",
4419,,Mother with Glasses,"Big Beard, I'd like you to meet a new member of my family -- Krystal",

4428,,Big Beard,But please allow me to say this…,
4429,,Big Beard,"(Gently looks at the young boy) In this world of chaos, the peaceful lives of our village children rests on the bloodshed of us warriors.",
4430,,Big Beard,"If those who can fight don't stand up, no one else would…",
4431,,Big Beard,"So please, allow me to challenge you.",
4432,,Big Beard,"If I win, I wish to invite you to join our battle squad.",
4433,,Krystal,"(Glancing at mother and son, then glancing at Big Beard) A peaceful life is built on the bloodshed of warriors?",

4456,,Krystal,"Ah, are you okay?",

4459,,Krystal,"(Pointing) Healing magic, restore!",
4460,,,Big Beard's wound rapidly diminished and his pain faded away.,
4461,,Big Beard,"(Oh, it feels fine now… or rather, I'm full of energy…)",
4462,,Big Beard,"Miss Krystal, could this be... magic too?",
4463,,Krystal,"Yes, it's healing magic…My favorite magic…",

4470,,,Today is a great day to farm.,
4471,,,The mother brought her son and Krystal to their farm plot after chasing away Big beard who was waiting outside to see Krystal in the morning.,
4472,,,"In order to avoid the sandstorm and chaos creature invasion, the crops were deeply buried beneath the soil relying on the sun energy collected by the surface crystals.",

4476,,Mother with Glasses,(Holding a hoe) This area is our plot.,
4477,,Mother with Glasses,The weather's really great today. Let's loosen the soil here.,
4478,,Mother with Glasses,"This way, the crops buried deeply below can fully absorb the crystal's energy.",

4505,,,The villagers celebrated as they survived through another attack.,
4506,,,"However, the crops in the field are destroyed.",
4507,,,The once consistent fields were now ravaged by battle. Broken vegetable leaves scattered across the ground.,
4508,,,The villagers who were once pleased with their crops now fell into devastation.,
4509,,Villager A,"Oh, God… you've taken my family and now destroyed my crops… How am I to continue living?",
4510,,Villager B,My vegetables… you were all that I had left… How could you just…,
4511,,Krystal,…,
4512,,Big Beard,I'm really sorry that we were unable to protect the fields for everyone…,
4513,,Villager C,"What's the use of an apology… especially that little mage, waving her magic everywhere and destroying our vegetables!",
4514,,Krystal,(With eyes shut) It's my fault…,
4515,,Young Boy,Sis…,
4516,,Big Beard,"My comrades, we've damaged the fields but what we've protected are your lives!",
4517,,Big Beard,"(Asserting voice) Some of your crops may have been damaged, but it does not mean all hope is lost!",
4518,,Big Beard,At least not all the corps were destroyed…,
4519,,Big Beard,As long as…,
4520,Goddess of Miracles (Part 2),Assertive Voice,"As long as a seed remains, the power of the Gods will bestow it life.",
4521,,Assertive Voice,"Roots produce stems, developing into buds until its bears fruit.",
4522,,,"Krystal closed her eyes, listening attentively to the cries of the villagers and the tremble of her crystal, when a sudden thought occurred.",
4523,,,Krystal walked barefoot to the center of the field.,
4524,,,She felt the crystal and sand beneath her feet as well as the shattered vegetables.,
4525,,,She felt life from the depths of the earth and felt their desire to grow…,
4526,,Krystal,….the Goddess of wishes and miracles once again heed your prayers.,
4527,,Krystal,Come forth and grow!,
4528,,,Her eyes opened as she casted both hands to the ground.,
4529,,,"A ray of sunlight reflected upon the crystal on her tail, darting and flickering.",
4530,,,"If one looked close enough, they would be surprised to find that the crystals across the fields were flickering to the beat her crystal tail.",
4531,,,"With every crystal and every flicker, a glimmer of light slipped through the crystal and into the cracks of the earth.",
4532,,,"Somewhere deep down, a dormant seed sprouted.",
4533,,,"Somewhere in the depths, a root that was withering started to grow and grow until the visible eye could see it…",
4534,,,"Countless crops emerged from the depths of the earth, one by one turning their leaves and bearing their fruits....",
4535,,,"In the blink of an eye, the traces that were left by battle were completely concealed by crops that sprouted.",
4536,,,"The villagers stared in awe. Magic of life materializing before them and encircling Krystal, awakening the seeds buried deep below....",
4537,,,Green and golden crops now completely covered the barren land.,
4538,,Villager A,Mag…magnificent...,
4539,,Villager B,Is this young girl really just a mage?,
4540,,Elderly Man,This can only be described as a miracle…!,
4541,,Elderly Man,"According to ancient scripts, this is the power of the Goddess of Miracles!",
4542,,Krystal,Phew… (lightly grasping for breath) A strange person is approaching…? Hello?,
4543,,Elderly Man,"(Praying aloud) Allow me to worship at your feet! Oh, benevolent Goddess of Miracles!",
4544,,Krystal,"(Blushing) No, no, you must be mistaken. I'm…",
4545,,Young Boy,Hmm? So you're a Goddess! Sis is the Goddess of Miracles!,
4546,,Villager A&B,Oh! Allow me to also worship at your feet! Benevolent Goddess of Miracles!,
4547,,Villagers,Allow us to worship at your feet! Benevolent Goddess of Miracles!,
4548,,Girl in Gray,(Looks up quietly) Our Goddess looks amazing…,
4549,Hope,,In the corner of the street sat a lonely girl dressed in gray.,
4550,,Girl in Gray,"How wondrous, our Goddess of Miracles… If I pray to her, I wonder if my wishes will be come true?",
4551,,Girl in Gray,"Ah, she must has seen me…",
4552,,Girl in Gray,She's coming towards me! What should I do?,
4553,,,Krystal caught sight of the feeble looking young girl pacing back and forth that once reminded her of herself.,
4554,,,"She reached out and waved her magic, in that instant the young girl's complexion restored to it's health and shape.",
4555,,,"As Krystal walked along the road, she found injured villagers from the previous battle and healed them one by one.",
4556,,,"The villagers were frightened by the increased appeareance of creatures, but with the Goddess of Miracles amongst them, they weren't frightened anymore.",
4557,,Villager,Praise to Goddess!,
4558,,Krystal,It's my pleasure~,
4559,,Krystal,"(Hehe, being treated  as a Goddess is quite interesting)",
4560,,,……,
4561,,Shapeless Chaos Creature,The crystal energy here is abundant...,
4562,,Shapeless Chaos Creature,For the past two days my minions have gone out to test the waters and return with surprises. I wonder just how juicy this prey is? Hehehe…,
4563,,Shapeless Chaos Creature,"(Watching low level chaos creatures from a distance) However, these useless things that can't even think for themselves,",
4564,,Shapeless Chaos Creature,"Do they need an eternity to complete the job? They just need to prepare a simple plan, my patience is growing thin…",
4565,,Shapeless Chaos Creature,I'm just one step close to the prey and yet they're making me wait...,
4566,,Shapeless Chaos Creature,"Once the plan is complete, I'll turn these useless creatures into my meal, hahaha…",
4567,,Krystal,"(Suddenly pops out) You there, what are you scheming?",
4568,,Shapeless Chaos Creature,Eek!,
4569,,Shapeless Chaos Creature,You! You… How did you find me?,
4570,,Krystal,I've planted the crystals here to gather immense energy. This is a trap any greedy monster like you would fall for.,
4571,,Krystal,"I, the Goddess of Miracles shall rid you with my magic!",
4572,,Shapeless Chaos Creature,"(Rolling across the earth, fleeing from Krystal) Damn it, she can't be defeated!",
4573,,Shapeless Chaos Creature,"Wait… was she reckless enough to let me escape? You will regret underestimating me, hehehe…",
4574,,Shapeless Chaos Creature,My plan is about to commence!,
4575,,Shapeless Chaos Creature,In a short while we'll see whether you're still able to be my opponent! Hehehe,
4576,,,The particular chaos creature took a breath and melted into the cracks of the earth.,
4577,,,"Suddenly, the crystals on the surface nearby faded.",
4578,,,And the smell of decay emitted from the earth.,
4579,,,"At that moment, numerous shapeless creatures of chaos hid into the ground.",
4580,,,"As they exposed to the gas, they started to merge, creating a large smoke…",
4581,,,"Within a second, dark purple smoke had engulfed the village…",
4582,,Shapeless Chaos Creature,A part of my body shall turn into gas and devour all energy across this land until its out of control!,
4583,,Shapeless Chaos Creature,Lure the wolf with the hen! This is my wildest day ever! Hahahahahahah!,
4584,,Shapeless Chaos Creature,Hah… I'm almost out of control…,
4585,,Shapeless Chaos Creature,Then… LET IT EXPLODE!,
4586,,,A deafening bang pierced the air as a treacherous smell ignited.,
4587,,,A roaring flame enough to light up the night descended from the sky.,
4588,Just an Ordinary Girl,,A deafening noise of explosion sounded from the village.,
4589,,,"In search of the chaos creature, Krystal did not react in time and could only view from afar…",
4590,,,"And when she finally noticed what happens to the village, it is too late.",
4591,,,The sound of explosions and cries tore through the village.,
4592,,,……,
4593,,Krystal,Oh no! Mama and …,
4594,,,Krystal almost forgot that humans are feeble.,
4595,,,"Krystal rushed back to the village, encountering outcries from the villagers as the flames engulfed their homes.",
4596,,,"As she ran, she caught a glimpse of a shattered figure laying closely nearby.",
4597,,,The torn pieces of gray clothing were vaguely visible.,
4598,,,"She stopped in her tracks, wanting to move towards it but realized that she could not revive the dead.",
4599,,,……,
4600,,Mother with Glasses,(Holding the young boy's hand) Krystal! Thanks god you're still alive…,
4601,,Krystal,"Mama! I'm so sorry! It's all my fault, I've put everyone in danger…",
4602,,Mother with Glasses,Don't say that… (Hugging Krystal) You'll be alright!,
4603,,Young Boy,(Eyes red from tears) Sis… I'm going to become just like you! I want to become even stronger! I want to avenge the village aunties and uncles!,
4604,,Mother with Glasses,(A slight smile while patting the boy's head),
4605,,Krystal,"(Eyes staring with renewed determination) Mama, go find a safe place to hide for the both of you. I'll be right back…",
4606,,,……,
4607,,,"Upon the entrance of the village, Krystal came across the particular chaos creature.",
4608,,,"Ever since parting with that person, Krystal had not felt such rage and guilt in a very long time.",
4609,,,Her eyes glistened as her crystal tail trembled with rage.,
4610,,,She stepped barren onto land as tremedous energy erupted from her tail.,
4611,,Shapeless Chaos Creature,(Stunned) This… this can't be!,
4612,,Shapeless Chaos Creature,"My energy has completely corrupted this land, every crystal was supposed to have lost its energy…",
4613,,Shapeless Chaos Creature,How could you have converged this amount of energy!?,
4614,,Krystal,Did you really think I needed to rely on desert crystals to defeat you?,
4615,,,"The creature suddenly realized Krystal's true strength. But it was already too late, it was unable to control itself…",
4616,,,"Even with trembling fear, it wanted to devour Krystal's energy. Perhaps, this is the craving instincts of the creatures of chaos.",
4617,,Shapeless Chaos Creature,I've underestimated you…! Come and show me your true power!,
4618,,Shapeless Chaos Creature,Cough… can't move…,
4619,,Krystal,Final question. Why are you after me all along?,
4620,,Shapeless Chaos Creature,Cough… why?,
4621,,Shapeless Chaos Creature,Because no creature can resist the smell of you!,
4622,,Shapeless Chaos Creature,"You might have defeated me, but other chaos creatures will keep coming. Wherever you go, destruction shall follow!",
4623,,Shapeless Chaos Creature,"Sooner or later, a greater creature of chaos will devour your energy. That... is your fate! Hahaha… cough cough…",
4624,,Shapeless Chaos Creature,Live… IN FEAR!,
4625,,Krystal,"… … disappear, you vulgar creature.",
4626,,,"As if none of it had occurred, the creatures, the smoke and flames had completely vanished.",
4627,,,"Krystal examined the state of the village and with her magic, she restored it back to life.",
4628,,,Even those that were left with their last dying breath revived back to health.,
4629,,Elderly Man,"(Kneeling at Krystal's feet) Oh, benevolent Goddess of Miracles, you saved us once again!",
4630,,Survivors,Benevolent Goddess of Miracles!,
4631,,,"Amongst the kneeling villagers, many familiar faces are now missing.",
4632,,,"In the end, she was unable to save those that had lost their lives.",
4633,,Krystal,"(Frowning) So that's it… Wherever I go, chaos will follow…",
4634,,Krystal,I've brought danger to everyone… I'm so sorry…,
4635,,,"From the earth's purest crystal, a teardrop formed and fell from the end of Krystal's tail.",
4636,,,The teardrop fell silently onto the ground.,
4637,,,"And the decay of land instantly revived as the crystals sparkled once again, as if they had not been ravaged.",
4638,,,"But before the villagers realized, Krystal had silently vanished from sight.",
4639,,,……,
4640,,,"In a vast desert. The sun peeped through the entrance of the cave, slowly reaching the depths. A young girl awakens.",
4641,,Krystal,My name is Krystal and I shall live through this day.,
4642,1,Raphael,How about being my assistant for just a few days? It won't be long.,What?
4643,,,"During one of my visits to the infirmary, Raphael caught me abruptly with a strange request.",
4644,,,"Raphael is currently the only doctor on campus, single-handedly taking care of everyone's health and leaving herself with few opportunities to take a break from the infirmary.",
4645,,,This is partially due to her busy workload and partially due to not wanting to leave the infirmary unattended in case that someone was injured.,
4646,,,"As a result, she sleeps in the infirmary while her dormitory is left as deserted as an empty warehouse.",
4647,,,She works extremely hard that you can't help but want to help her. But the real question is…,Why me?
4648,,Raphael,"Oh, because you look like you've got a lot of time on your hands.",…|Can't argue with that.
4649,,Raphael,I'm just teasing~ It's because you're reliable.,Are you sure?
4650,,Raphael,"Don't worry~ It's not complicated, you'll just need tidy the medicine cabinet, take care of patients and so forth.",
4651,,Raphael,And… be my company and chat with me.,Chat with you?
4652,,Raphael,"Whether they're patients or not, students often come by just to chat with me, you know.",
4653,,Raphael,"I love listening to all the stories they tell, after all, it's the only entertainment I can have since I'm barely step out of here.",
4654,,Raphael,And you're the center of quite a few gossips.,
4655,,Raphael,So how bout it? Any interesting stories you'd like to share with me too?,
4656,,,…So there is an ulterior motive here after all.,
4657,,,Riiiiiiiiiiiiiing-------,
4658,,Raphael,"Oh, goodness.",
4659,,,"The sound of a bell suddenly rang, the bell is specifically designed for patients, of which most connects to the wards and one connecting to the main entrance.",
4660,,,Small lights are installed on the wall to signal and identify which ward it comes from.,
4661,,,"Looking at the numerically labelled light bulbs, I couldn’t help but imagine what if all of them lit up at the same time and pray that that day may never come.",
4662,,,"Judging from the current light that’s lit, someone is arriving from outside.",
4663,,Raphael,"I guess we'll have to talk about this later. But it's alright, we have plenty of opportunity.",
4664,,Raphael,"It's time to go greet the patients, my assistant.",
4665,,,…It sure seems like I wasn't given a chance to refuse the offer at all.,
4666,,,"A few hours later, in the evening.",
4667,,,"In the end, the students came in one after another made us too occupied to chat.",
4668,,,"Although a few of the visitors simply came to gossip, most however, came due to injuries that need immediate attention.",
4669,,,"Under Raphael’s instructions, I was running back and forth between the medicine cabinets and almost got lost inside.",
4670,,,"Meanwhile, Raphael was able to take care of multiple patients at a time, and though she was busy, she still remained graceful and calm.",
4671,,,"At dusk, the visitors gradually lessened.",
4672,,Raphael,"Training is almost over, and after this, there shouldn’t be many people left.",I need a good rest…
4673,,Raphael,"Oh, you haven't even experienced the busiest period yet.",
4674,,Raphael,"I remember during the sports festival and because of those awful activities, I was almost out of wards to provide…",You always look so calm. | You always look so graceful.
4675,,Raphael,"Oh, the flattery, what are you hoping to get from it?",
4676,,Raphael,"As a doctor, it’s especially important to remain calm at all times in front of patients.",
4677,,Raphael,This is the ground rule of a doctor.,
4678,,Raphael,"Well, that's it for today, I can handle the rest on my own.",
4679,,Raphael,"Here, thanks for the hard work. Take this before you leave.",What is it?
4680,,Raphael,"It’s a herbal medicine tea that I made, it’s very effective in relieving tiredness~",
4681,,,The liquid in the cup was glowing green with many unknown substances bobbing up and down on the surface.,Take a sip.
4682,,,I could only taste the medicine and not the tea...,
4683,,Raphael,Huh? What's wrong? Does it taste strange?,
4684,,,Raphael gazed at me with innocent eyes.,
4685,,,"I guess… after all, Raphael's just trying to help. A cup of tea won't kill me…",I guess I'll just have to swallow it.
4686,,Raphael,How is it?,Umm… it tastes great!
4687,,Raphael,"Well, you seem to like it. In that case, how bout another one?",
4688,,,……,
4689,,,And that is how I started helping out at the infirmary as Raphael’s assistant.,
4690,2,,One afternoon at the infirmary.,
4691,,,"As usual, I’ve been coming to the infirmary to help out and I’m gradually getting used to the work here.",
4692,,Raphael,"You're getting better and better, my little assistant~ Thanks to you, I'm much more at ease.",
4693,,Raphael,And there aren't many patients today as well.,
4694,,Raphael,"Well, looks like we can finally have a chat, then? I'll go get tea ready!",Hold on! | We don't have to have tea…
4695,,,Riiiiiiiiiiiiiing-------,
4696,,Raphael,"Oh my, someone's here again? But there's no training today...",
4697,,Panicked Student,Raphael…! Raphael…! Help…quick!,
4698,,Quinie,Owww… it hurts… my head hurts…!!!,
4699,,,Quinie is carried into the infirmary.,
4700,,,"Her face pale, and her teeth clenching so tightly that they were about to crack. Her lips seemed to have accidentally been bitten, oozing with thin lines of blood.",
4701,,,"With her free hand, she vigorously held on to her head, as if trying to dig out something from beneath the skin.",
4702,,Raphael,Take her to the ward immediately.,
4703,,Raphael,What happened to her?,
4704,,Panicked Student,I… I don't know…We were just walking when suddenly…,
4705,,Raphael,"Let's get her stabilized first! Assistant, come quick!",Okay!
4706,,Raphael,"Whew, job's finished…",
4707,,Panicked Student,Raphael… is she going to be alright?,
4708,,Raphael,"There’s no longer any danger for now, but… I can’t figure out what’s causing the symptoms.",
4709,,Raphael,"The flow of magic in her body is incredibly unstable, a lack of rest could cause something similar, but it shouldn't be this severe…",
4710,,Raphael,"Just in case, she should stay here for a while longer for us to monitor her condition.",
4711,,Panicked Student,"I see...... But I'm relieved you're here, Raphael. I'll be taking my leave then.",
4712,,Raphael,Be careful then.,
4713,,Raphael,……,
4714,,,"As the student left, Raphael’s expression turned to worriedness.",What's wrong?
4715,,Raphael,An unexplained cause of disease...,
4716,,Raphael,"Hopefully, nothing serious will happen…",
4717,3,,A few days later-----,How….
4718,,,A dozen or so patients with the same symptoms are lying in the infirmary.,
4719,,Raphael,"What's happening? Is it an infectious disease? No, there's no sign of it…",
4720,,Raphael,"Plus, the first infected student, Quinie is…",
4721,,Quinie,Ow… ow… oww…!,
4722,,Raphael,……！,
4723,,Raphael,"Don't worry, I'm right here. You'll be fine soon.",
4724,,,"Raphael reached out both hands on each side of Quinie’s head, with an effort to use magic to ease her pain once more.",
4725,,Quinie,Uhhhhhhhhhhhhh!,
4726,,,"Suddenly, Quinie's expression turned violent and…",
4727,,Raphael,Ouch!,Raphael…!|You got bitten!?
4728,,Raphael,"It's alright, I've had worse…",
4729,,Raphael,"Relax, I won't hurt you.",
4730,,,A soft light emitted from Raphael's hands and Quinie gradually calmed down and went to sleep.,
4731,,Raphael,……,
4732,,Raphael,The symptoms seem to be getting worse.,Your hand…|There's blood…
4733,,,The wound on her hand from the attack left an evident circular mark that is now bleeding.,
4734,,Raphael,"Oh, this…? Don't worry about it, it's just a scratch.",
4735,,Raphael,It's nothing compared to the pain they're going through.,
4736,,Raphael,"Rule number two, always care for others.",Let me bandage it up for you.
4737,,Raphael,"Oh, do you want to touch my hand that badly?",…………
4738,,Raphael,"Haha, I’m just teasing. After all, trying to bandage myself with one hand is a mission.",
4739,,Raphael,……,
4740,,Raphael,……,All done|Raphael?
4741,,Raphael,You're getting better and better at bandaging. Not bad for my assistant.,
4742,,Raphael,But ...... Why are so many students contracting this disease?,
4743,,Raphael,From what source could it have come from?,What do these patients have in common?
4744,,Raphael,Hmm… In common…,
4745,,,Raphael looked down at her bitten hand.,
4746,,Raphael,……！,Did you realize something?
4747,,Raphael,Perhaps… we need to check the food that they ate.,
4748,,Raphael,"As suspected, the same type of food was found.",
4749,,Raphael,Is this ...... a type of plant? It's not a common food…,
4750,,Raphael,Speaking of which… I recently heard that Sonya introduced a new dish in the cafeteria.,This is the one.
4751,,Raphael,"Since there was no digestive issues found, I’ve neglected this possibility. What a misstep on my part.",
4752,,Raphael,"But it's not too late yet. Come, pack the tools quick, my assistant.",
4753,,Raphael,"Ha ...... now that I think about it, it's been so long since I’ve left the infirmary.",
4754,,Raphael,"We need to make it quick, before the problem gets any worse…",Right away!
4755,4,Sonya,What? There's a problem with my new dish?,"Well no, we don't mean it in that way…"
4756,,Raphael,"Just to be sure, can we please see the ingredients that you used for this dish?",
4757,,Sonya,But... this is my exclusive recipe.,
4758,,Sonya,"Fine, seeing as it’s Raphael, I’ll show you guys.",
4759,,,Sonya took out a plant that bloomed radiant purple flowers.,
4760,,Sonya,This is it.,
4761,,Raphael,I've never seen this plant specie before.,
4762,,Raphael,A hint of dissonant magic could be felt from it though.,
4763,,Sonya,What's wrong? Is it poisonous?,
4764,,Raphael,"It doesn’t seem highly toxic, it’s more like it’s been contaminated by something.",
4765,,Sonya,It doesn't look or taste strange at all though.......,
4766,,Raphael,"If we can find the source of contamination, it could give us a lead to creating an antidote.",
4767,,Raphael,"Sonya, do you know where this plant is found? Is it a new specie bred by the Gardening Club?",
4768,,Sonya,"Well, actually Quinie brought them over. She found them in the forest.",
4769,,Raphael,Quinie…,But Quinie is in…
4770,,Raphael,……,
4771,,Raphael,"There's no choice, it's up to us now.",
4772,,Raphael,But firstly…,
4773,,Raphael,"Sonya, please find everyone who ate this dish and bring them all to the infirmary.",
4774,,Sonya,Huh? For what?,
4775,,Raphael,Everyone needs to be tested and the remainder of this ingredient needs to be destroyed. This dish also needs to be taken off the menu.,
4776,,Sonya,Nobody messes with my menu!,
4777,,Raphael,"Sonya, DO YOU HEAR ME?",
4778,,Sonya,"Yes, ma'am…",
4779,,Raphael,"Good, that's a good girl.",When Raphael is serious…|She seems kinda scary.
4780,,Raphael,"Is something the matter, my assistant?",No…Nope.
4781,,Raphael,"Never mind, it’s not the time to bicker, we’ve still got work to do before Sonya brings in all her infected customers.",
4782,,Raphael,Looks like we'll need to stay out of the infirmary for a little bit longer.,
4783,5,Raphael,"The forest… it’s been awhile since I came here, a lot has changed.",
4784,,Raphael,But it’s not the time to admire the view… Where can we possibly find these plants?,Do you have any idea?
4785,,Raphael,I've got a bit of a clue.,
4786,,Raphael,"Plants absorb nutrients from the soil, and if the soil is contaminated, the plants would be contaminated too.",
4787,,Raphael,"In other words, we can find the plant and the location of the source of contamination through finding the contaminated soil.",But…how do we find…
4788,,Raphael,Like this….,
4789,,,Raphael took out a few tiny bottles and collected soil from various locations.,
4790,,Raphael,Presence of the same contamination could be felt from the soil collected.,
4791,,Raphael,By comparing the difference in contamination level...... we can roughly get an idea of the direction of the source of contamination.,I see.
4792,,Raphael,"Found it, it's this way.",
4793,,,"After countless sample tests, we came across a location that we knew once we saw it that we had finally found the source location.",
4794,,,"Its flowers bloomed radiant purple, and as we proceeded further, the radiance faded darker and darker.",But how did she get here…
4795,,Raphael,"There’s nothing unusual about the air here, only the soil is contaminated.",
4796,,Raphael,It seems that the source of contamination is still deeper within… let’s keep moving.,
4797,,Raphael,It should be somewhere around here.,
4798,,Raphael,"Alright, let’s collect the samples and take them back for further examination.",
4799,,？？？,GRRRRRRR!!!,
4800,,,A sudden low growl sounded.,
4801,,,"It's a huge beast standing behind. Its front paws digging into the ground, breathing heavily.",
4802,,Raphael,A chaos creature...?,
4803,,Raphael,No… it might just be the effects from consuming these plants.,"Raphael, be careful!|Run!"
4804,,Raphael,We've gathered the necessary samples. But…,
4805,,Raphael,We can't just leave it like this.,
4806,,Raphael,"Besides, it's a good opportunity.",
4807,,Raphael,I shall demonstrate my battle skills to you.,
4808,6,Wild Beast,Grrrrrrrr!!!,
4809,,,"Raphael managed to dodge the beast's sharp fangs by a hair, which sent shivers down my spine from watching.",
4810,,,"Although she was not injured till now, this condition wouldn't last long.",
4811,,,But it doesn't look like she's going to fight back at all…,"Raphael, why aren't you…"
4812,,Raphael,Don't panic. Always remain calm.,
4813,,Raphael,"If you look closely, you should have noticed that my ""attack"" has already begun.",
4814,,,The wild boar seems to be moving slower than before? Is it because it’s getting tired?,
4815,,Raphael,"As soon as battle began, I spread a large amount of anesthetic in the air.",
4816,,Raphael,"Now, we are just waiting for the anesthetic to take effect.",
4817,,,But the wild boar's attack was still ferocious.,
4818,,Wild Beast,Grrrrrr!!!,
4819,,,"Once again, Raphael was able to dodge a wild attack by a striking distance.",
4820,,Raphael,"The anesthetic was only able to slow it down by a little, but it is still within expectations.",We need to get a Discipline Member here.
4821,,Raphael,We don't have enough time to wait for a Discipline Member to get here.,Are you referring to the students in the infirmary?
4822,,Raphael,"No, I'm worried about them too, but I'm not talking about them.",
4823,,*,Then…?,
4824,,Raphael,"Rule number two, always care for others.",
4825,,Raphael,This creature… is going through so much pain.,
4826,,Raphael,It's the tremendous pain that’s causing it to become so violent that even my anesthetics are hardly taking effect.,
4827,,Raphael,"With such pain, it might not be able to hold up for long.",So that's why…
4828,,Raphael,Seems like you have understood now.,
4829,,Raphael,"From this battle, I’ve roughly found a way to ease its pain.",
4830,,Raphael,But I'll need your help…,
4831,,Raphael,Are you ready?,Ready!
4832,7,Raphael,Sleep tight…,
4833,,,"With a soft light emitting from Raphael’s hand, she caressed the ferocious beast’s head.",
4834,,,"Immediately, the beast fell to the ground, motionless, releasing a loud snore.",
4835,,Raphael,Everything's fine now… You'll feel better soon.,
4836,,Raphael,……,
4837,,Raphael,"Rule number three, never give up on a single life.",
4838,,Raphael,My goal was never to defeat it.,
4839,,Raphael,"As a doctor ...... my only two enemies will always be ""disease"" and ""pain"".",
4840,,Raphael,This creature ...... is just another poor patient.,
4841,,Raphael,"I’ve only temporarily eased its pain, but to heal it completely…",
4842,,Raphael,It’ll all depend on these samples…and our efforts going forward.,Let's do our best!
4843,,Raphael,We've not reached the toughest part yet.,
4844,,Raphael,"Assistant, bring me the reagent!",Coming!
4845,,Raphael,Assistant! Go check up on patient three…!,Heading over!
4846,,Raphael,"A new patient's arrived, quick, get the ward ready!",Gotcha!
4847,,Raphael,Fetch all the medicine on this list!,Roger that!
4848,,Raphael,Assistant…!,Coming!
4849,,Raphael,Assistant…,……
4850,,Raphael,It's finally… over…,
4851,,,"After several days of struggle, the antidote was complete.",I feel so tired…
4852,,Raphael,But this is all worth it!,
4853,,,"Raphael got up from her chair, as if she's about to break into dance from happiness.",
4854,,Raphael,"Come on, don't just stand there, let's celebrate!",
4855,,,Although I was going to celebrate just by observing Raphael from aside…,
4856,,,She suddenly came over.,！？
4857,,Raphael,"Oh, you’re feeling shy now? I guess, that’s cute too.",(Got teased…)
4858,,Raphael,"Alright, quickly distribute this to everyone, the sooner the better.",
4859,,Quinie,Mmm…mmm…,
4860,,Quinie,Mmm…? Where… am I?,
4861,,Raphael,We did it!,
4862,,Raphael,You're finally awake! You're at the infirmary. How do you feel?,
4863,,Quinie,A bit lightheaded but no longer in pain.,
4864,,Raphael,"Good to hear… the slight discomfort will fade shortly, now you just need to rest for a while to fully recover.",
4865,,Quinie,Thank you... Raphael.,
4866,,Quinie,"Also, I think… I ate something soft and tender in my dream…",
4867,,Quinie,I want to taste it again…,That's…
4868,,Quinie,….What? It was Raphael's hand!? I'm soooo sorry….,
4869,,Raphael,Don't worry about it.,
4870,,Raphael,If you really mind it…,
4871,,,Raphael picked up Quinie's hand and bit down gently.,
4872,,Raphael,"Well, now we're even~",……
4873,,Quinie,Ah…,
4874,,Raphael,"Alright, rest well~ Time for me to check up on other patients.",
4875,,Raphael,Whew… Looks like everyone’s safe and sound…,
4876,,Raphael,What's wrong?,Your hand…
4877,,Raphael,That's not something we need to worry about now.,
4878,,Raphael,Our job isn't done yet.,What?
4879,,Raphael,Don't forget that we've still got a very big patient waiting for us in the forest.,
4880,8,,A few days later-----,
4881,,,Raphael distributed the antidote she prepared to all the students who had the dish from the cafeteria.,
4882,,,And the patients in the infirmary gradually recovered.,
4883,,,The plants that were highly contaminated in the forest were all destroyed and the soil got purified.,
4884,,,"As for the wild boar, it disappeared into the depths of the forest and never to be seen again after Raphael healed it.",
4885,,,Everything seems to have gone back to normal with our daily lives.,It's finally over…
4886,,Raphael,Yes… It sure is.,
4887,,Raphael,"Here, this is a gratitude herbal medicine tea.",Not again…
4888,,Raphael,This is after experiencing this incident that gave me the creativity to brew this tea.,
4889,,Raphael,I’ve even added several new medical ingredients that I haven’t used before!,Did you add that flower too…
4890,,Raphael,"Oh my, of course not! Stop hesitating and give it a try~",Take a small sip.
4891,,,A faint bitter taste spreads through my mouth.,
4892,,,"…It definitely tastes better than the last one, but I still can't escape that medicine taste.",
4893,,Raphael,How is it? I've specially adjusted it for you.,Really?
4894,,Raphael,Do you honestly think you can fool me with your expression after tasting my tea?,
4895,,Raphael,Paying attention to how others feel is also a rule of a doctor.,Then… can you add sugar…
4896,,Raphael,Of course not~,
4897,,Raphael,I’ve reached a perfect blend of nutrition and efficacy in this mixture.,
4898,,Raphael,By adding sugar would affect its effectiveness.,I see…
4899,,,"After taking a sip, the taste on the tongue was still bitter, but after the tea entered the stomach, a hint of sweetness could be felt for some reason.",
4900,,Raphael,……,
4901,,Raphael,You've really worked hard these past few days.,
4902,,Raphael,"We’ve only agreed for you to be my assistant for a few days, yet you’ve helped out all the way.",It's alright.
4903,,Raphael,Weren't you reluctant at first?,"I've learned a lot from you, Raphael."
4904,,Raphael,What if… I ask you to assist me in the future again?,I'll be glad to.
4905,,Raphael,……,
4906,,Raphael,"Oh my, you've really picked the words I like to hear.",
4907,,Raphael,But I can't keep you here all to myself…,
4908,,Raphael,You are everyone's Senpai after all.,I suddenly… feel sleepy…
4909,,Raphael,Finally sleepy…?,
4910,,Raphael,"It's fine, you can sleep without worry, no one will disturb us now.",
4911,,Raphael,"Come, rest your head on my knees.",……
4912,,Raphael,"By the way, I did not expect something like that to happen.",
4913,,Raphael,"If it weren’t for you, I’m afraid the situation might’ve gotten out of hand.",
4914,,Raphael,It's also because of this ...... that the project had to be delayed until now.,……(Drifts off to sleep.)
4915,,Raphael,……,
4916,,,"Raphael gets up gently and quietly, and carefully carries * to a bed.",
4917,,,"From a drawer, she took out a small syringe.",
4918,,,"The tip of the needle glowed silver in the moonlight, gently piercing into *'s fingertips. The transparent syringe quickly turned red.",
4919,,Raphael,……,
4920,,Raphael,"I’m sorry, this research… regarding The Source, it’s better if fewer people know about it.",
4921,,Raphael,You're a patient who needs my care too.,
4922,,Raphael,"This is for you, for the academy… and for me to complete my mission as a doctor.",
4923,,Raphael,Although it can’t be counted as making amends either…,
4924,,,"Raphael gently bit onto the finger that was still bleeding, sat down next to * and placed *'s head onto her knees.",
4925,,Raphael,"At least for tonight, let me keep you company......",
4926,Born in the Wild,,The Wilderness,
4927,,,Perhaps this place was not sparsely populated before.,
4928,,,But right now it looks desolate and lifeless.,
4929,,,It's probably just been ravaged by chaos.,
4930,,,"A gracious and beautiful soul reaper,",
4931,,,awakens from the dust.,
4932,,,She looked around with contempt and let's out a soft chuckle.,
4933,,Scythe,Ahhh~,
4934,,Scythe,The scent of death… in desolate places…,
4935,,Scythe,"It’s a pity there isn’t a living soul, otherwise a harvest right here would’ve been perfect~",
4936,,,She gently stretches.,
4937,,,Her posture displaying elegance yet danger.,
4938,,Scythe,"Since I’ve already woken up, then it’s time to seek a hunting ground~",
4939,,Chaos Creature,Roar!,
4940,,Scythe,Perfect timing for a warm up!,
4941,,Scythe,It's weaker than I imagined…,
4942,,Scythe,"In comparison to fighting these filthy creatures,",
4943,,Scythe,I'd much prefer a tasty soul~,
4944,A Growing Fruit,,"After a fierce battle,",
4945,,,the creatures were defeated and the soul reaper gracefully took their lives.,
4946,,Scythe,I'm so bored.,
4947,,Scythe,Harvesting souls are so much more fun~,
4948,,Scythe,Hm…?,
4949,,Scythe,A child… crying?,
4950,,Little Girl,Waaahhhh…,
4951,,Scythe,A soul sent right to my doorstep?,
4952,,Little Girl,Daddy… Mommy…,
4953,,,"Oh, how weak and small it is…",
4954,,,The soul reaper thought contemptuously,
4955,,,If you miss your dead relatives so much,
4956,,,I can send you off to see them.,
4957,,Older Woman,A child… There's a child here…,
4958,,Older Woman,What a poor child…,
4959,,Older Woman,Come over here… dear child.,
4960,,,Is she being adopted?,
4961,,,The soul reaper stares at,
4962,,,this strange human behavior.,
4963,,,Whether blood-related or not,
4964,,,this behavior of helping others in need without asking for anything in return.,
4965,,,"The soul reaper, Scythe, who could not understand this bond",
4966,,,quietly watched as it occurred in front of her.,
4967,,Scythe,"Well, that makes harvesting no fun at all or I can wait until the seeds of hatred sprout and once its fruit has ripened then shall it be ready for harvest.",
4968,,Scythe,I’ll wait until you’re grown and then I’ll be back to harvest your soul.,
4969,,Scythe,"After all, a ripe fruit is more delicious, isn't it?",
4970,We Meet Again,,A human life is just a few dozen years. It passes in a flash.,
4971,,,"For a Girl who cannot measure the length of her life, a few years meant nothing.",
4972,,Scythe,♪~ Who's soul shall I harvest today~,
4973,,Scythe,"Alas, it's a bustling town.",
4974,,Scythe,It hasn't been ravaged by chaos and has modern equipment...,
4975,,Scythe,And the produce is abundant.,
4976,,Scythe,Even its people seem well and lively.,
4977,,Scythe,Let's stay here for a while.,
4978,,Scythe,Seems like I'll be able to harvest some pretty good souls here.,
4979,,Scythe,Hm…?,
4980,,,"Although it was momentary,",
4981,,,but there is no mistaking the scent,
4982,,,to the passing figure.,
4983,,Scythe,"Oh, she's grown~",
4984,,Scythe,Seems like she's been well.,
4985,,Scythe,Let's see how much the fruit has ripened.,
4986,Starting Connection,Young Girl,Mother… are you all right?,
4987,,Older Woman,Cough… This old body is weakening by the day.,
4988,,,The woman caresses the girl's head.,
4989,,Older Woman,"I thought that by bringing you back, I could give you a better life…",
4990,,Young Girl,I'm already living a better life.,
4991,,Young Girl,The years I've spent with mother has been the happiest days of my life…,
4992,,,The soul reaper outside the window watched as before…,
4993,,,Quietly watching it all as it occurs.,
4994,,,What tedious bonds humans have.,
4995,,,She thought to herself.,
4996,,Scythe,(Muttering to herself) Seems like this woman's soul will be harvested first.,
4997,,Young Girl,……,
4998,,Scythe,……,
4999,,,"Following the young girl's line of sight, Scythe realized that she was examining her.",
5000,,Scythe,"I'm certain I've used magic to cover myself, yet she is still able to see me?",
5001,,Scythe,What strange fate.,
5002,,Scythe,(Mouths) I am taking her soul~,
5003,,Young Girl,……,
5004,,Scythe,What? Not even a little scared…,
5005,,,How boring---,
5006,,,The soul reaper thought and decides to leave.,
5007,,,"As she took a few steps, she felt a light tug at the hem of her clothes.",
5008,,Young Girl,Please… please wait.,
5009,,Scythe,You're quite brave…,
5010,,Scythe,…to stop me.,
5011,,Young Girl,Are you the soul reaper?,
5012,,Scythe,If you know who I am then I assume you understand what I do?,
5013,,Young Girl,……,
5014,,Scythe,"I will be taking your mother's soul with me, if I do so, I can relieve her pain too.",
5015,,Scythe,Or would you like to be taken away with her?,
5016,,Young Girl,……,
5017,,,Scythe looks at the girl and reveals a malicious smile.,
5018,,,But the girl just stares blankly showing no sign of fear.,
5019,,Scythe,……,
5020,,Young Girl,(Muffled voice) Do you really have to take her away?,
5021,,Scythe,Dear dear...,
5022,,,Harvesting her soul was not as fun as she imagined.,
5023,,,The soul reaper thought,
5024,,Scythe,There's no use begging me.,
5025,,,Why is she not afraid of me?,
5026,,,Doesn’t everyone usually look at me with terrified eyes?,
5027,,,This human… is interesting…,
5028,,Scythe,Go away---,
5029,,,Waving away the hand of the girl,
5030,,,The soul reaper raises her scythe towards the dying woman.,
5031,,,"This is just another parting of a short human life, thought the soul reaper.",
5032,The Caregiver,,The soul reaper that harvested the soul continued to roam within the town.,
5033,,Scythe,I'm so bored…!,
5034,,Scythe,I wonder how that girl is doing?,
5035,,Scythe,I wish I could see the look of fear on her face towards me.,
5036,,Scythe,Ahh…,
5037,,,While the soul reaper awaits her fruit to ripen,
5038,,,sometimes…,
5039,,,she would go comfort the girl that had lost her loved one,
5040,,,Sometimes she gave her food,
5041,,,Sometimes she gave her things,
5042,,Young Girl,"You're here again, Miss Soul Reaper?",
5043,,Scythe,I'm just passing by.,
5044,,Scythe,(This girl is not afraid of me at all),
5045,,Young Girl,"Miss Soul Reaper, you've been taking good care of me.",
5046,,Young Girl,And I want to thank you! You are kind and gentle.,
5047,,,Kind and gentle?,
5048,,,The soul reaper reveals a look of contempt.,
5049,,Young Girl,How can I repay you?,
5050,,Scythe,"Heh heh, with your soul, of course.",
5051,,Scythe,Are you willing to give your life to me?,
5052,,Young Girl,"If you want it, I am willing to give it to you.",
5053,,,This was not the reaction the soul reaper expected,
5054,,,nor the repayment that was needed.,
5055,,Scythe,"Oh, how boring.",
5056,,Scythe,"Harvesting a soul that has no attachment to the world, I think it's meaningless.",
5057,,Scythe,"When your soul has become more delicious, then I will be back to harvest your soul.",
5058,,Young Girl,Delicious…,
5059,Conflicting Emotions,,From the moment she was created,
5060,,,"She had no ""human"" emotions",
5061,,,She did not understand why she would awaken in a place like this,
5062,,,"And now, her only desire is to harvest souls every day.",
50639999,,Scythe,Will Miss Soul Reaper come again today?,
5064,,Scythe,"My my, you're actually praying to see the soul reaper?",
5065,,Young Girl,You came after all!,
5066,,Young Girl,Seeing you every day gives me strength.,
5067,,Scythe,……,
5068,,Scythe,Urrrghhh… So annoying so annoying so annoying!,
5069,,Scythe,How does such a person exist!,
5070,,Scythe,Don't forget that I am a soul reaper!,
5071,,Scythe,Do you think that I'm taking pity on you?,
5072,,,The soul reaper smirked at the girl.,
5073,,,The girl's emotions were few since the passing of her mother.,
5074,,,And only showed subtle mood changes when the soul reaper was around.,
5075,,Scythe,I hope you know you're just a pastime.,
5076,,,That's right,
5077,,,Just like having a pet.,
5078,,,The occasional acts of support are merely from a spur of the moment.,
5079,,Scythe,Like the mere existence of a cricket.,
5080,,Scythe,Nothing more---,
5081,,,The soul reaper picks up her scythe and wields it towards the girl.,
5082,,,The scythe stops in front of her forehead.,
5083,,,As her bangs lifted from the breeze.,
5084,,Scythe,……,
5085,,Scythe,Not even a flinch?,
5086,,,Harvesting such a soul…. How pointless.,
5087,,,No fun at all.,
5088,,,No…,
5089,,Scythe,Geez! I'm not interested anymore! I'm leaving!,
5090,,,It's not that…,
5091,,,she couldn't do it.,
5092,,,Thought the soul reaper,
5093,,,as she reveals a cheeky smile.,
5094,,Scythe,Food that is personally seasoned will be more tasty~,
5095,,Scythe,Hmm hmm hmm~ Guess I shall wait for my fruit to ripen then.,
5096,In Opposite,,There is always a person humming a song in my dream.,
5097,,,I don't know if it's mother.,
5098,,,Then the fire came,
5099,,,And creatures started to howl,
5100,,,The village was destroyed.,
5101,,,"In the fragmented dream, the last thing that emerged",
5102,,,or the last thing remaining,
5103,,,"was a beautiful, playful figure.",
5104,,Young Girl,Ah…,
5105,,Young Girl,Miss Soul Reaper?,
5106,,,"For some reason, the girl was happy to see the soul reaper in her dream.",
5107,,,While the soul reaper would only mock her dreams.,
5108,,Young Girl,I dreamt of it again yesterday…,
5109,,Scythe,I'm not interested in human dreams.,
5110,,Scythe,"I am malevolent. If I were to taint your dreams with darkness, it would be of great pleasure~",
5111,,Young Girl,But… you always appear in pure white light.,
5112,,Young Girl,"As if, to save me.",
5113,,Scythe,……,
5114,,,The soul reaper seemed unhappy looking at the girl's expressionless face.,
5115,,Scythe,"With such a look on your face, telling me that you were saved by me… Who are you trying to convince?",
5116,,Scythe,Pure white… That doesn't suit me at all.,
5117,,Scythe,There's no need to tell me such things. I was just passing by and checking if you were drawing your last breath.,
5118,,Scythe,If you were... then I'd be happy to save you from your misery.,
5119,,Scythe,Or would you rather prefer to die now?,
5120,,,"She remained expressionless, quietly looking at the soul reaper.",
5121,,Scythe,……,
5122,,Scythe,"No fun at all. I'll be heading back for today. Oh, and those ridiculous things you say, keep them to yourself.",
5123,,,She's just like a pet.,
5124,,,The soul reaper thought,
5125,,,as she turned to leave.,
5126,Torn,Scythe,Well well~ The creatures bordering the village are quite weak as well.,
5127,,Scythe,I've been chasing these creatures recently that I haven't even had the time to harvest souls~,
5128,,Scythe,"But then again, quality is important after all~",
5129,,Scythe,The previous ways of only seeking quantity is not enough.,
5130,,,How is my fruit growing?,
5131,,Scythe,Let's go visit her today~,
5132,,,……,
5133,,Scythe,……,
5134,,,The soul reaper's eyes widened.,
5135,,,What occurred in front her seemed unbelievable.,
5136,,,Whether it be humans,
5137,,,or chaos creatures,
5138,,,they all seemed vulnerable to her.,
5139,,,But---,
5140,,Scythe,Why…?,
5141,,Scythe,……,
5142,,,The city was enveloped in fire. The remnants of the city's former past reflected in the blazing fire.,
5143,,,The creatures roared.,
5144,,,The town,
5145,,,no longer had much human presence remaining.,
5146,,Scythe,……,
5147,,Scythe,I just left for a short while…,
5148,,Chaos Creature,Roar---,
5149,,Scythe,"Damn it, who dares to misbehave in front of me.",
5150,,Scythe,I'll show you what happens when you hunt in my hunting ground ---,
5151,,Scythe,……,
5152,,,In her moment of victory,
5153,,,she felt a sudden emptiness.,
5154,,,A feeling that she had never felt before.,
5155,,Scythe,The girl.,
5156,,Scythe,Did she die too?,
5157,Heart of Humanity,,Like a ragged doll.,
5158,,,Judging from the condition of the Girl,
5159,,,Her soul was evidently ready to be harvested.,
5160,,,But there was an odd feeling.,
5161,,Young Girl,Miss Soul Reaper?,
5162,,Young Girl,"Cough, cough. This time I'll have to ask you to harvest my soul.",
5163,,Young Girl,I'm… so sorry… for the trouble.,
5164,,Young Girl,"I'm in pain… My chest… My ribs, I think they're broken.",
5165,,Young Girl,But after seeing you… It feels like my pain has gone away.,
5166,,Young Girl,Please… take my soul.,
5167,,Scythe,……,
5168,,Scythe,You're hopeless.,
5169,,Scythe,Getting hurt so easily by such a pathetic insect,
5170,,Scythe,"Well, your nature isn't that far apart after all.",
5171,,,The soul reaper once again held up her scythe.,
5172,,Scythe,"Goodbye, little one.",
5173,,Scythe,Even if you're hopeless.,
5174,,Young Girl,……,
5175,,,The soul reaper looked at the dying girl,
5176,,,as a smile was left upon the young girl's face.,
5177,,,An expression that would not be expected from a dying girl.,
5178,,,This was the biggest emotion she had expressed since the passing of her mother.,
5179,,Scythe,……,
5180,,Young Girl,I am so thankful… to you.,
5181,,Young Girl,"I think… I'll be sleeping again. But unfortunately, I won't be able to tell you my dream this time.",
5182,,Scythe,……,
5183,,,The soul reaper looked at the lifeless girl.,
5184,,Scythe,I didn't plan to listen to you anyway...,
5185,,Scythe,Urggggghhhh…. What's going on.,
5186,,,The harvest of the long-awaited fruit was not as delightful as she imagined.,
5187,,,The soul reaper thought.,
5188,,,She had never imagined,
5189,,,Perhaps this brief bond gave back what she had once lost.,
5190,,,"This ""useless"" thing",
5191,,,"called ""emotion"".",
5192,Yume Academy?,*,Huff---,
5193,,,This was seriously far.,
5194,,,I had no idea you could get this far on the School Excursion.,
5195,,,I must've gotten lost.,
5196,,,"By the time I realized it, I was long gone from the pack.",
5197,,*,"Without enough food and no girls around… What if, what if I run into chaos creatures…",
5198,,,I am already guessing whether,

5200,,Chaos Creature,Roar---,
5201,,*,"Seems like between survival and disaster, the disaster always comes first…",
5202,,,Perhaps I won't survive to see the day.,

5210,,Scythe,Do you want to be my servant?,
5211,,Scythe,You don't seem like the type that will die easily,
5212,,*,……,
5213,,,How do I explain it to her?,
5214,,,"Well, we can begin with proper introductions first.",
5215,,,"After all, we'll be schoolmates soon.",
5216,,,The stars are aligned differently tonight.,
5217,,,Vivian gazed at the night sky unmovingly. I did the same out of curiosity and quickly understood what caused her to do so.,
5218,,,Starlight gathered at the roof of the Dorm Building.,
5219,,,They formed a six-pointed star that glowed dimly in the dark sky.,
5220,,*,What is happening? Is the world ending?,
5221,,Vivian,"Not exactly. I believe this is caused by someone opening a gate to another Plane. The Plane where time flows, perhaps.",
5222,,*,Another Plane? Time?,
5223,,,"This reminds me of a certain self-proclaimed ""Daughter of Time"".",
5224,,Vivian,"I'd like to pay a visit to Monica. Would you like to come with me, Senpai?",
5225,,*,"Monica, are you there?",
5226,,Monica,S-Senpai and Vivian? Do you need anything?,
5227,,Vivian,"Nope, but we're guessing that you're up to something in your room. Are we right?",
5228,,Monica,…I'm just sorting the Memory Fragments I collected over the years.,
5229,,Vivian,"Memory Fragments…they hold bits and pieces of memories, but not everyone can read them. However, those that do have the ability… can learn much from them.",
5230,,Monica,Exactly.,
5231,,Vivian,"I heard that certain Fragments have their own will. If they acknowledge the person reading them, they might even offer presents to the reader.",
5232,,Monica,"That does happen from time to time. However, what the present will be depends largely on the reader and how much the Fragment likes them.",
5233,,Monica,They mostly offer pieces of clothing or accessories.,
5234,,*,Sounds fun. You get to peek into the secrets of others and get some cool outfits in return. Awesome!,
5235,,Vivian,"Senpai, please stop whatever that you're planning now.",
5236,,*,I'm not planning anything wicked. I'm just wondering whether we can learn more about Chaos from those memories.,
5237,,Monica,The possibility exists.,
5238,,*,Can I try reading one?,
5239,,Monica,"I'm not sure. You see, not everyone has the ability to read a Memory Fragment.",
5240,,Monica,"What's more, the content of each Fragment is different. I won't be able to guarantee that you will find what you want from them.",
5241,,Vivian,That sounds like a refusal.,
5242,,Monica,"Don't get me wrong, I'd love to help if Senpai asks for it. However, I have to warn you about the risks; I am not quite sure how much effort it will require for a regular human being to read a Fragment.",
5243,,Monica,"If you are absolutely certain that you want to do so, I will be glad to offer you the Memory Fragments I have collected.",
5244,,*,I'm sure we can find useful information from the Fragments. Where do I start?,
5245,,Monica,"This way. Welcome to the World of Time, Senpai~",
5063,,,Will Miss Soul Reaper come again today?,
5246,,,"One day, Aquaris was training with swords. Mika, who was just passing by, watched for a while and gave her some advice.",
5247,,,"However, what happened next was out of anyone's expectations: Aquaris bothered Mika day and night, asking Mika to coach her in swordplay. In the end, Mika caved, though she will only give advice and will not hold the sword herself.",
5248,,,"Soon, Mika instructing Aquaris on the finer aspects of swordplay became a common sight on the training grounds. As they spent more time together, they decided to share a Dorm room, and Aquaris found out about Mika's hidden past…",
5249,,Mika,No!!!!!!,
5250,,Aquaris,Master Mika?!,
5251,,,"Aquaris heard Mika screaming in her dreams and rushed to her bed, looking worried.",
5252,,Aquaris,Is it the same dream again? It's the third time this week…,
5253,,,Mika had a frightened expression on her face and breathed heavily as if she was still stuck in the nightmare.,
5254,,Mika,"I-I'm fine, don't worry…",
5255,,Aquaris,"You don't look fine…Let's go back to sleep, you can still catch some shut-eye until the sun rises…",
5256,,Mika,"I'm sorry for waking you, but I doubt I can.",
5257,,Mika,"Even if I try to sleep, I will see the same scene replaying before my eyes...",
5258,,,Mika looked out of the window.,
5259,,Mika,I think…I'll go for a walk instead.,
5260,,Aquaris,I'll keep you company then!,
5261,,Mika,You should go back to sleep or you won't have enough energy for our training session later.,
5262,,,Mika grabbed a thin coat and headed for the door.,
5263,,Aquaris,Master Mika! If you need someone to talk to…I am a really good listener!,
5264,,Mika,…It's okay. It's not important…,
5265,,Aquaris,Why is Master Mika out on a walk this early in the morning…?,
5266,,Aquaris,"I'll just follow her, and make sure everything is alright. This doesn't count as stalking, right?",
5267,,Aquaris,"Hmm, what is she doing in the woods? Is she making a clay doll?",
5268,,Aquaris,"Wow, the craftsmanship of the doll is amazing!",
5269,,Aquaris,"Wait, I think she's talking to the doll.",
5270,,Mika,It's my fault…I'm sorry…I should have protected all of you…,
5271,,Aquaris,Who is she apologizing to…?,
5272,,Mika,"If I had a shield at the time, I would have kept you from harm…",
5273,,Mika,"…but all I had was a sword, and I couldn't have done that with a sword.",
5274,,Mika,…I met another girl. I want to be able to accomplish what I failed last time…,
5275,,Aquaris,"Girl? Last time? She's speaking so softly, I can't hear everything clearly.",
5276,,Aquaris,She seems so sad…,
5277,,Aquaris,What is happening? Should I try and comfort her?,
5278,,Aquaris,"…Maybe not, I'll just mess things up anyway. Besides, I don't feel I should do that when she's not willing to share her thoughts with me.",
5279,,,"The sun is about to rise, and sunrise is the coldest time of the day.",
5280,,,"Aquaris hesitated, but still walked towards Mika, covering her with the heavy blanket she brought with her.",
5281,,Mika,…Aquaris?,
5282,,Aquaris,"You left with nothing but a thin jacket on, and I was worried that you'd get cold.",
5283,,Aquaris,So I brought you a blanket!,
5284,,Mika,"…Thank you, Aquaris. Go back to sleep, I'll stay here for a bit longer.",
5285,,Valeera,"Hello, Aquaris!",
5286,,Valeera,"It's a rare sight to see you away from your ""Master Mika"" these days.",
5287,,Aquaris,"Stop teasing me, Valeera!",
5288,,Valeera,You look depressed. Did you two have a fight or something?,
5289,,Aquaris,Of course not! I will never argue with Master Mika. It's just…,
5290,,Valeera,It's just?,
5291,,Aquaris,"Master Mika didn't rest well last night, so I decided not to bother her today.",
5292,,Aquaris,…I feel like there are so many things burdening her. If only she would share some of them with me…,
5293,,Valeera,"Well, don't we all have burdens? It will be up to her to decide when or whether to share them with you. All you can do before that is to wait and to be there for her.",
5294,,Aquaris,"I understand. Anyways, I'm here today for training. Can you help me with the illusions again?",
5295,,Valeera,Of course~,
5296,,,Valeera created an illusional training field for Aquaris.,
5297,,,The illusions of Chaos Beasts were too realistic and caused Aquaris to panic.,
5298,,,"She felt a migraine assaulting her senses, and all of a sudden, the training grounds before her transformed into the scene of a past memory.",
5299,,,"Endless waves of Chaos Beasts separated Aquaris from her teammates, and she was powerless to defend herself without them.",
5300,,Aquaris,Help me…Please…Anyone…Please…,
5301,,,"She was surrounded by the foul creatures, but nobody showed up despite her pleas.",
5302,,,Aquaris was exhausted and was about to give up when her savior appeared.,
5303,,,"It was a swordmaster, finishing off the Chaos Beasts around her faster than she could blink.",
5304,,？？？,"Looks like we're here in time to save this girl, or else she would have fallen victim to those Beasts.",
5305,,,"The swordmaster's companions said, while the swordmaster herself just checked Aquaris over for any wounds, and relaxed when she found none.",
5306,,,"Light shone from behind her, and she looked almost holy in Aquaris' eyes.",
5307,,Aquaris,Thank you for saving me.,
5308,,？？？,"Don't worry, nothing will hurt you now.",
5309,,,"She smiled gently at Aquaris, and her figure disappeared like mist dispersed by sunlight.",
5310,,Valeera,Aquaris! Can you hear me? Aquaris!,
5311,,,"When Aquaris opened her eyes, she was laying on the ground with Valeera beside her, trying to wake her up.",
5312,,,"She got to her feet, wobbling a bit when she tried to balance herself.",
5313,,Aquaris,I'm fine…I think. I just saw something that happened in the past.,
5314,,Valeera,Which one? The one where you were saved by the stranger when you almost died?,
5315,,Aquaris,Exactly. If only I could meet her again...I'll tell her that I can stand my ground against the Chaos Beasts now!,
5316,,Valeera,"Really? From my perspective, you will need more training before actually taking on one.",
5317,,Aquaris,"I'm working my way towards it, at least.",
5318,,Valeera,"Good luck with that. By the way, Mika is here for you.",
5319,,,Aquaris turned around to see Mika waiting for her.,
5320,,Aquaris,Master Mika! I'm so sorry.,
5321,,Mika,What are you apologizing for?,
5322,,Aquaris,"I wasn't strong enough despite all the training sessions we went through, and I was knocked out…again.",
5323,,Mika,"It's okay. You have improved a lot since you first started, and your strength has grown as well.",
5324,,Aquaris,"Really? Thank you, Master Mika!",
5325,,Aquaris,"Master Mika, did you see me make a fool out of myself back then? I must've been pretty lame…",
5326,,Mika,"I was watching you train, but I can't recall anyone making themselves a fool.",
5327,,Aquaris,"I've been learning from you for such a long time, yet the illusions were still too difficult for me…",
5328,,Mika,"It's not your fault. I was talking with Valeera back there, and she said that she made the routine harder than usual.",
5329,,Aquaris,"Really? Okay, I feel a lot better now.",
5330,,,Aquaris scratched her cheek shyly.,
5331,,Aquaris,"I want to be a strong swordmaster someday, and be admired by everyone in the Academy!",
5332,,Mika,A swordmaster? It’s not easy wielding a sword. Are you really prepared for it?,
5333,,Aquaris,"Of course! Perseverance is one of my few virtues, after all.",
5334,,Mika,"I believe in you, Aquaris. If you keep training, you will surely achieve your goals.",
5335,,,Mika sighed at Aquaris' wistful expression.,
5336,,,"She was reminded of the past, of a time when she was looked up to by many others.",
5337,,Companion A,"Wow, this cave is filled to the brim with treasures and gold! We've hit the jackpot this time!",
5338,,Mika,"Good, we can share them with the villagers. They'd be glad.",
5339,,Mika,We've been away from the village for way too long. I wonder if they missed us.,
5340,,Companion A,Sharing the treasures with them? That's such a good idea!,
5341,,Companion B,"Right! Mika, you will be getting a lot more admirers soon!",
5342,,Mika,Admirers? What are you two going on about?,
5343,,Companion A,"Aww, don't be embarrassed, you're the Master of Swords! It's only natural that people look up to you.",
5344,,Mika,That's nothing but a title. I'm happy as long as those I care about are happy.,
5345,,Companion A,"By the way, I saw a little girl making a clay doll of you. She even speaks to it super respectfully pretending that she is speaking to you!",
5346,,Companion A,"Mika, you definitely have to meet her after we return to the village.",
5347,,Mika,"Making a clay doll of me? Kids will be kids, I suppose.",
5348,,Companion A,This means that she admires you very much!,
5349,,Mika,I don't get it…,
5350,,Mika,"But sure, I'd like to meet her.",
5351,,,Mika and her companions returned to her homeland with their spoils.,
5352,,Villager,"Mika, welcome back to the village!",
5353,,Mika,It's been quite a while. We brought some treasures we found on our travels and would like to share them with everyone.,
5354,,Villager,"Thank you, thank you! I don't know what I can do to repay you for all the kindness you've shown us…",
5355,,Mika,It's nothing. I'm not doing this because I wanted to be rewarded.,
5356,,Companion A,"Mika, look, that's the girl I was talking about earlier!",
5357,,,A little girl hugging a clay doll tightly stood in the direction where Mika's companion pointed.,
5358,,Little Girl,"Mika! Wow, I can't believe it, I've finally met you in person!",
5359,,Mika,"…Hello there, can you tell me what it is that you're holding onto?",
5360,,Little Girl,"Oh, it's you, Mika! The Master of Swords!",
5361,,Mika,It's…me?,
5362,,Little Girl,It keeps me company when you're away on your travels.,
5363,,Little Girl,"…and somehow, I feel like you're right beside me this way! Isn't it amazing?",
5364,,Mika,Really? You must like it a lot then.,
5365,,Little Girl,"No, no, that's not what I mean. I mean, I do like it, but I like it because I like you, Mika!",
5366,,Mika,…Me?,
5367,,Little Girl,"Indeed! You're the person that I respect the most, Mika!",
5368,,Aquaris,Master Mika? Are you alright? You look deep in thought…,
5369,,Mika,I was just reminded of something that happened in the past. It's not important now.,
5370,,Aquaris,"Oh, okay? By the way, Master Mika, why don't you ever wield a sword yourself?",
5371,,Aquaris,"I'm not saying that your lessons are hard to understand, it's just that I think it would help me a lot if you can show them to me instead of just using words.",
5372,,Mika,"Tips and advice from me are enough for now, I think.",
5373,,Mika,"Besides, it's a bit too early for that. You need to work harder before you can learn the more complicated tricks and maneuvers that require my demonstration.",
5374,,,Mika changed the subject without answering her question. Aquaris shook her head dejectedly.,
5375,,,"Mika couldn't fall asleep that night. She tossed and turned in bed, but sleep evaded her.",
5376,,,"Aquaris, being in the same room as Mika, was aware that something was wrong. However, she didn't have the courage to ask what was bothering her mentor.",
5377,,,"When Mika finally fell asleep, she dreamed.",
5378,,Companion A,"Look, it's the purple clouds again. Can it be the influence of Chaos…?",
5379,,Mika,"Let's head to the village. As long as we're there, no harm shall come to the villagers.",
5380,,Companion A,I wish I shared your confidence…but I guess that's what makes you different from us.,
5381,,Companion A,"Mika, Chaos Beasts have invaded the village! The villagers are panicking and escaping in all directions, and the situation is getting out of control.",
5382,,Mika,…Let's hurry.,
5383,,,"Violet mists drifted throughout the village huts, and the villagers are running for their lives. Mika and her companions stood between the Chaos Beasts and the villagers, protecting them from harm.",
5384,,,Her determination was unwavering even when facing the endless waves of Chaos Beasts.,
5385,,Mika,Stay behind me!,
5386,,,She fought and destroyed every Chaos Beasts that came at her.,
5387,,Mika,"Look, all of them are gone! We're safe…now?",
5388,,Mika,(Turns around) …Why…are everyone down?,
5389,,Mika,"What's going on…? The village is in ruins, and the villagers are all…",
5390,,Mika,Why…? I defeated all of the Chaos Beasts…why is this happening?,
5391,,,"When she turned around, all she saw were the smoking remains of the village and the mangled bodies of the villagers.",
5392,,Mika,The Chaos Beasts that I fought were only a distraction…,
5393,,Mika,"…and I walked right into the trap they prepared for me, focusing only on the decoys.",
5394,,Mika,They took over the village when I was distracted…,
5395,,Mika,"What I had was no confidence but arrogance, and my failure cost the lives of the villagers…My sword…wasn't able to protect anyone…",
5396,,Mika,I wasn't able to protect everyone…,
5397,,,Aquaris was woken by Mika's sleeptalking. Her voice was filled with pain and regret.,
5398,,,Aquaris got out of her bed and walked towards the sleeping form of Mika.,
5399,,,She tried to smoothen out the frown on Mika's sleeping face but to no avail.,
5400,,,The village was in ruins. All that remained were smoking husks of the huts.,
5401,,,"The lives of its inhabitants have been taken away by the Chaos Beasts as well, and only some of Mika's companions survived.",
5402,,,"However, Mika couldn't face them.",
5403,,Mika,It's…all my fault…,
5404,,Companion A,Mika…Mika…the little girl…is still alive. It's not too late yet…,
5405,,Companion A,I can't fight anymore…but you still have a chance to save her…,
5406,,Mika,The girl? She's still alive?!,
5407,,,Mika rushed to the building where her companion last saw the little girl and found her curled against the corner.,
5408,,Mika,…You're still holding onto the doll.,
5409,,Little Girl,Of course! I know that Mika will be here to save the day! I knew it!,
5410,,Mika,I-I will. You're safe now. Nothing will hurt you anymore.,
5411,,,"Mika stood in front of the little girl, fighting back the Chaos Beasts that tried to come near to her.",
5412,,,But the Chaos Beasts were too many and she couldn't take on all of them at once. Some of them sneaked past her defenses and headed for the little girl.,
5413,,Mika,Don't touch her!,
5414,,Little Girl,Mika…,
5415,,,"The endless fighting slowed Mika down, and the Chaos Beasts got to the little girl before she could stop them.",
5416,,Little Girl,Mi…ka…Help…me…,
5417,,,"Life left the little girl's eyes before she was able to complete the sentence, and all that remained was her crumpled body on the ground.",
5418,,,The Chaos Beasts swiftly retreated. Mika lost any will to keep fighting.,
5419,,Mika,Why is this happening…,
5420,,Mika,"My home is destroyed, and my family killed…but I…",
5421,,Mika,…I did nothing.,
5422,,Mika,"…This is the clay doll that she held onto, even before her death.",
5423,,Mika,…But it didn't save her life.,
5424,,Mika,What's the point of this? It only gave her false hope and false dreams!,
5425,,,"Mika crushed the clay doll underneath her boot with no hesitation,",
5426,,,even if it is a replica of her slashing at her enemy with her sword.,
5427,,Mika,The Master of Swords? What good does this title bring?,
5428,,,The young life that passed away right in front of her eyes weakened Mika's resolve and will.,
5429,,Mika,What use is this sword of mine? No matter how many Chaos Beasts I slew…I wasn't able to protect anyone.,
5430,,Mika,It's as good as gone!,
5431,,,"With a painful howl, she snapped her sword in half.",
5432,,Mika,No!!!!!!!!,
5433,,Aquaris,"Master Mika, is everything alright? You seem pained…",
5434,,Aquaris,"Wait, are you crying…?",
5435,,Mika,…You ask too many questions.,
5436,,Aquaris,"Master Mika, it's okay if you want to cry. Reining in all your emotions is bad for your health!",
5437,,,"Aquaris' words were surprisingly considerate, especially when she is usually pretty dense.",
5438,,Aquaris,…Why are you so reluctant to hold a sword again?,
5439,,Mika,Aquaris…why do you want to learn swordplay?,
5440,,Aquaris,"I was weak, and I needed help from others.",
5441,,Aquaris,I don't want to be a burden to others. I want to become strong.,
5442,,Aquaris,I want the strength to protect others like me!,
5443,,Mika,So that's your reason. I never thought to ask…,
5444,,Mika,Protecting others is very different from protecting yourself only. Do you have what it takes to face the difficulties of your goal?,
5445,,Aquaris,I was once protected by another swordmaster.,
5446,,Aquaris,"If she can do it, then so can I!",
5447,,Mika,…Can swords protect instead of only being used to attack…?,
5448,,,Aquaris unsheathed her sword and raised it.,
5449,,Aquaris,Holding the hilt of this sword makes me feel safe.,
5450,,Aquaris,"It's like the swordmaster that saved me is right beside me, cheering me on…",
5451,,Aquaris,…and I feel power flowing from the sword into my veins.,
5452,,Mika,……Are you sure you're not hallucinating?,
5453,,Aquaris,I'm not!,
5454,,Aquaris,"Besides, if it wasn't for the swordmaster, I wouldn't be training so rigorously now!",
5455,,Mika,What did she tell you?,
5456,,Aquaris,She said that I needed to become independent because there isn't always someone there to save me. When nobody is there for me…I need to be there for myself.,
5457,,Aquaris,That's the reason why I wanted to train with a sword.,
5458,,Aquaris,"You didn't answer my question yet, Master Mika.",
5459,,Aquaris,Why are you so reluctant to hold a sword again?,
5460,,,"Aquaris had an honest expression on her face, but Mika was unable to bring up the reason.",
5461,,,"The past was too heavy, too harsh; it weighed down on her, especially when she tried to pick up her sword again.",
5462,,,All Mika could do was shake her head.,
5463,,,Aquaris realized that she may have touched a nerve. She remembered Valeera's advice from a small while ago:,
5464,,,"""It will be up to her to decide when or whether to share them with you. All you can do before that is to wait and to be there for her.""",
5465,,Aquaris,"…I didn't mean to intrude. If you're not willing to share the reason with me, then it's okay that you don't.",
5466,,Aquaris,"But just as I said before, if you need me, I'm a really good listener!",
5467,,Aquaris,"I will always be there for you, just as you have done for me!",
5468,,Aquaris,"You have always led my way, like a lighthouse in the darkest night…",
5469,,Mika,"Alright, alright.",
5470,,Mika,"Of course I trust you. We have spent so much time together, it's more than enough for me to judge one's character.",
5471,,Aquaris,"I have no idea what happened to you in the past, but I can tell you what happened to me.",
5472,,Aquaris,"Several years ago, my team was sent to get rid of the Chaos Beasts that were invading a village outside of the Academy.",
5473,,Mika,Did you succeed?,
5474,,Aquaris,…There were more Chaos Beasts than expected.,
5475,,Aquaris,"What's worse, the village was built at the edge of a cliff.",
5476,,Aquaris,"When the Chaos Beasts attacked, there was no way for the villagers to escape.",
5477,,Aquaris,"…Aside from throwing themselves off the cliff, but it's too dangerous.",
5478,,Mika,It must have been hard for you.,
5479,,Aquaris,The purple mist emitted by the Chaos Beasts surrounded the village…,
5480,,Aquaris,Animals and villagers alike were corrupted by Chaos.,
5481,,Aquaris,Even my teammates were influenced; allies could become enemies in the blink of an eye.,
5482,,Aquaris,…A villager that helped me a lot after I arrived was corrupted as well.,
5483,,Aquaris,"She used to smile kindly at me, but after she was corrupted, the only thing that remained in her mind was violence towards others…",
5484,,Aquaris,"I…I was weak. Unlike others, I cannot ignore my emotions to focus on the greater picture…",
5485,,Mika,Did you hesitate?,
5486,,Aquaris,"…I couldn't raise my weapon against her, and she attacked us ruthlessly…",
5487,,,Aquaris turned her gaze to the ground with regret in her voice.,
5488,,,Mika could see where this is going.,
5489,,,The result of that battle probably wasn't the deciding factor for Aquaris' regret.,
5490,,,It stems from the fact that her hesitance and weakness caused others to get hurt.,
5491,,Aquaris,"In the end, everyone in my team was forced to the cliffside by the hordes of Chaos Beasts.",
5492,,Aquaris,We were caught between a rock and a hard place.,
5493,,Aquaris,I fought to the extent of my abilities but I was overpowered.,
5494,,Aquaris,"Before I lost consciousness, I thought that all of this could have been avoided if I was strong enough.",
5495,,Aquaris,…Maybe none of this would have happened then.,
5496,,,Aquaris shook her head in frustration.,
5497,,Aquaris,I thought I wouldn't make it out of that village alive.,
5498,,Aquaris,"My mind was adrift and I was on the verge of giving up, until…",
5499,,Mika,Until?,
5500,,Aquaris,Until I heard the voice of my saviors. The Swordmaster and her companions.,
5501,,Mika,What did they say?,
5502,,Aquaris,It's sort of funny now that I think about it. One of her companions told me to stop sleeping and start defending myself because it's not wise to be sleeping when surrounded by Chaos Beasts.,
5503,,Mika,"(Giggles) It is a bit funny, but isn't it a bit too harsh to say to a girl who almost died?",
5504,,Aquaris,That's what I thought! The Swordmaster herself was a lot kinder though.,
5505,,Aquaris,"She saved my life. Sadly, I wasn't able to see her face because the light that shone from behind her blinded me.",
5506,,Aquaris,But I remembered what she told me!,
5507,,Aquaris,She said that only the ones that are strong and independent and protect others.,
5508,,Aquaris,"…And that's why I decided to start training with a sword, so I can be as strong as her, the Master of Swords!",
5509,,Mika,…Who?,
5510,,Aquaris,The Master of Swords!,
5511,,Aquaris,"Or at least, that's what her companions called her. The title fits her well though.",
5512,,Aquaris,"She is strong and kind, and it's only natural that she is respected and admired by all!",
5513,,,Mika stared at Aquaris upon hearing the title that she once held.,
5514,,,(This is familiar…Can it be…?),
5515,,Aquaris,"She gave me a sword too! My weapon broke back then, so she gave me her spare one so I can practice with it.",
5516,,Mika,Her…sword?,
5517,,Aquaris,Yes! I hid it under the mattress.,
5518,,Aquaris,"Look, here it is!",
5519,,,Aquaris retrieved the sword from its hiding place and presented it to Mika.,
5520,,Aquaris,"I just couldn't bring it in myself to use it for daily training…I mean, what if I break it?",
5521,,Mika,(…Just as I thought. This was the same sword…),
5522,,Aquaris,…Are you alright?,
5523,,Aquaris,You had a really far-away look on your face…,
5524,,Mika,"I just remembered something, don't worry.",
5525,,Aquaris,I'm sorry for bothering you tonight…my stories were probably very boring compared to what you have gone through.,
5526,,Mika,Not at all. I am interested in your past too.,
5527,,Aquaris,"I just wanted to express the importance of the sword to me, and perhaps ignite the passion you had for swordplay in you again!",
5528,,Aquaris,"I mean, if wielding a sword is so painful for you, I'd be really insensitive to keep pestering you for sword training sessions…",
5529,,,Mika smiled at the honesty that Aquaris showed.,
5530,,Aquaris,"Oh my, it's so late now! Let's head to bed before the sun rises again.",
5531,,Aquaris,"Just, I don't know, don't think too much about it? You might feel better this way?",
5532,,Mika,"Good night, Aquaris. I'll try your advice.",
5533,,,"After that night, Mika started to see Aquaris in a different light.",
5534,,Mika,(She's working harder day by day…),
5535,,,What Aquaris said jogged Mika's memory.,
5536,,,"The incident with the spare sword and Aquaris, whom she saved at the cliff.",
5537,,,The same girl that is taking lessons from her.,
5538,,Mika,"(…I had almost forgotten about it, focusing only on my mistakes...Who would have thought that the action I took at the time had such an impact?)",
5539,,Mika,(It's hard to believe.),
5540,,Aquaris,Master Mika! Did you see the trick I just did?,
5541,,Mika,Which one?,
5542,,Aquaris,The one that I just did! Did you miss it?,
5543,,Aquaris,"I feel that I'm doing something wrong, but I can't put a finger on it.",
5544,,Aquaris,Should I show you again?,
5545,,Mika,Go ahead. I'll be watching more attentively this time.,
5546,,,Mika smiled gently at Aquaris.,
5547,,Aquaris,Here I go~,
5548,,,"The sword in Aquaris' hand glittered in the sunlight, like the sparkling memories that Mika had in the past…",
5549,,Mika,"Aquaris, enough.",
5550,,Aquaris,"Huh? Wait, you're here in the training grounds instead of watching from aside this time.",
5551,,Aquaris,What's going on today?,
5552,,Mika,You keep on messing up at the same spot.,
5553,,Mika,"Listen, you need to pay attention to your side, like this. If a sword pierces your side, you won't have enough time to parry it.",
5554,,Aquaris,"Oh, you're right!",
5555,,Aquaris,So…like this?,
5556,,Mika,Not quite.,
5557,,Aquaris,It's so tricky…what should I do?,
5558,,Mika,"If you think this one's tricky, I don't know what you'll do when you start practicing the hard ones.",
5559,,,Mika sighed and accepted the sword Aquaris handed her.,
5560,,,The sword that once belonged to her.,
5561,,Mika,"Here, I'll demonstrate it to you.",
5562,,Mika,"Watch carefully, because I'm not sure whether I will do this again.",
5563,,Aquaris,…………,
5564,,,Aquaris was stunned into silence.,
5565,,,Mika looked exactly like the Swordmaster that saved her.,
5566,,,I was too focused on the mistakes I made…,
5567,,,One wrong step doesn't negate the other feats I have achieved nor the influence I had on others.,
5568,,,I shall never forget the painful memories; they are a part of me now.,
5569,,Mika,"However, I will take up my sword again. It has given hope to so many others, including this girl under my wing.",
5570,,,"The future is filled with endless possibilities,",
5571,,,"and the heritage of the Master of the Swords will not be lost, even if I no longer acknowledge myself with this title...",
5572,,Monica,"""Flowers of all colors were in full bloom, and as the wind blew through them, it was like countless butterflies fluttered their wings in the grass fields...""",
5573,,,"Monica sits in front of a window, reading quietly from a book. She imagines the scene as described from the words and smiles.",
5574,,Monica,Maybe I should decorate my room with flowers too.,
5575,,Monica,"But...I don't know what types of flowers there are, let alone how to take care of them. I should ask KongMing; she knows almost everything.",
5576,,,"Soon later, a knock can be heard from KongMing's door.",
5577,,Monica,"KongMing, it's me, Monica.",
5578,,KongMing,Monica? Come in. I didn't expect a visit from you.,
5579,,Monica,"I was reading yesterday, and the author made a beautiful metaphor regarding flowers.",
5580,,Monica,I want some flowers in my room too. I think they will...brighten up the room.,
5581,,KongMing,Sounds good. I've always found comfort from the several potted plants I keep in my room.,
5582,,Monica,"And that brings the topic back to my visit. Do you happen to know what types of plants or flowers don't require too much attention, suitable for someone like me who has never taken care of plants before?",
5583,,KongMing,"I'm glad that you came to me, but unfortunately, I am no botany expert.",
5584,,Monica,"...No? But I thought...No, it doesn't matter. Is there anyone else that I can consult regarding this matter?",
5585,,KongMing,How about Bud Elf?,
5586,,KongMing,She belongs to the Gardening Club.,
5587,,Monica,"...I've never met her in person before. KongMing, would you mind introducing us?",
5588,,KongMing,"Sure. Let's go then, the Gardening Club is this way.",
5589,,Monica,Thank you.,
5590,,,"The Garden of the Gardening Club is filled with all types of plants and flowers. There are signs of them being watered recently, but no one could be seen.",
5591,,Monica,It seems like we've missed them.,
5592,,KongMing,"Perhaps, but it's not hard to find Bud Elf. She fusses over her plants 24/7.",
5593,,KongMing,She is probably tending to some flower bushes on campus right now.,
5594,,Monica,...Oh. It's rare to find someone being this devoted to their cause these days.,
5595,,KongMing,She values her plants over everything else and speaks to them. She wears her heart on her sleeve: she smiles when the flowers bloom and frowns when they wilt.,
5596,,KongMing,"Students not familiar with her believe that she is simple-minded, naïve, and deluded.",
5597,,Monica,This Bud Elf person sounds like quite the character.,
5598,,KongMing,She is definitely a unique one.,
5599,,KongMing,"There she is, among the bushes not far ahead.",
5600,,KongMing,"Bud Elf! ...Bud Elf, can you hear me?",
5601,,Bud Elf,"Huh? Oh, it's KongMing. Shh, you're scaring my flowers.",
5602,,KongMing,"My bad, my bad.",
5603,,,Monica is taken aback by their exchange. Bud Elf is just as how KongMing had described her.,
5604,,Bud Elf,"So, is there a reason why you and Monica are here? I'm in the middle of something…",
5605,,KongMing,Monica here would like to ask for your advice on household plants. Would you mind recommending some plants or flowers that don't require a lot of attention? She's new to this.,
5606,,Bud Elf,"Hmm, that's a hard request. Every plant or flower requires care and attention. As long as you put enough effort into it, then no flower is too hard to take care of.",
5607,,Bud Elf,Whether you would like to exert this type of effort is up to you.,
5608,,Monica,Um...all I wanted to know is whether there is a type of flower that doesn't need too much attention. There must be at least one plant you know that fits the description...?,
5609,,,Bud Elf shakes her head.,
5610,,Bud Elf,"Nope. It takes effort to cultivate plants, no matter what type it is, even the cactus. I have to talk to them and learn about their individual needs to make sure they grow healthy and strong.",
5611,,Monica,(She is more focused on the feelings of plants than actual people...),
5612,,Monica,Alright then…,
5613,,,Monica seems dejected. KongMing bids Bud Elf goodbye then leaves Bud Elf to her own devices.,
5614,,Monica,I should probably do some research myself. Bud Elf...is just like you said. I don't understand why she values plants over people.,
5615,,KongMing,"Typical behavior of Bud Elf. She's very devoted to what she cares about, and it's her plants.",
5616,,Monica,She reminds me of Aquaris.,
5617,,KongMing,Aquaris?,
5618,,Monica,They're not completely identical but share that odd simple-mindedness.,
5619,,Monica,"When I first arrived in the Academy, Aquaris was responsible for setting up the stage. It was a sloppy job.",
5620,,Monica,A stage light wasn't secured properly and almost fell right onto Raphael.,
5621,,KongMing,"Ah, I remember the performance. You were there to save the day, weren't you?",
5622,,Monica,"...Yes. I know that she doesn't mean harm, but she's just...not the brightest one on campus.",
5623,,KongMing,I see why you made the connection now.,
5624,,KongMing,"Aquaris may seem simple-minded, for the lack of a better word, at first glance. However, this doesn't stop her from being one of the most well-liked people on campus.",
5625,,KongMing,"Aside from the accident you mentioned, she has helped out quite a lot. Without her, we wouldn't be so...closely-knitted.",
5626,,KongMing,"Everyone has their place in a group: the charming and eloquent ones become leaders, like Presidents of the six Houses.",
5627,,KongMing,The kind and caring ones smooth out conflicts in the group.,
5628,,KongMing,"And the ones like Aquaris, who are ""simple-minded"", who doesn't take many things to heart, make the chemistry a lot less strained in the group.",
5629,,KongMing,Being honest and not calculating are great qualities in all types of relationships.,
5630,,Monica,...I never thought about this from this perspective.,
5631,,KongMing,"Take your time to think about it. With your countless years of watching people, you should be able to understand in no time at all.",
5632,,Monica,...What do you think about Bud Elf?,
5633,,KongMing,Bud Elf? She is more creative and unique than the average student. She has her own special perspective of the world.,
5634,,KongMing,"A quality that is essential to the progress of human civilization, I'd say.",
5635,,,The words show wisdom beyond her years. Monica finds herself respecting KongMing even more.,
5636,,,"Monica's impression of Aquaris changed after her talk with KongMing, but she still believes that it isn't good to be detached from the outer world like Bud Elf.",
5637,,,"After all, effort and hard work are needed to ensure everything goes smoothly without trouble.",
5638,,,Only those deep in touch with the world and its inhabitants can help it progress and grow.,
5639,,,Monica is so immersed in her thoughts that she ignores the person calling her name.,
5640,,*,"Monica? Hey, Monica!",
5641,,*,I've been trying to catch your attention for the past few minutes. Please don't tell me that you are ignoring me on purpose.,
5642,,Monica,"S-Senpai...I'm sorry, I was thinking.",
5643,,*,Would you like to share with the class?,
5644,,Monica,"I spoke with KongMing yesterday, and she said something that stuck with me.",
5645,,Monica,She said that a person who has their own special perspective of the world is more creative and unique than others.,
5646,,*,Were you talking about Dr. Sivney? She's one of the most creative and special people that I've met.,
5647,,Monica,"...Erm, no, it was Bud Elf.",
5648,,*,"Bud Elf is rather creative too. I heard that she was working on this irrigation system for her plants...she can be seen as an inventor too, I guess.",
5649,,Monica,Does Dr. Sivney think like Bud Elf too?,
5650,,*,"Hmm, to be honest, I don't know. Why don't we ask Sivney in person?",
5651,,Monica,...Wouldn't we be bothering her with our questions? It would be awkward if she kicked us out of her lab because of this...,
5652,,*,"Aww, don't worry, she won't just throw us out like that. I know her.",
5653,,*,"You know, I didn't expect you to be this shy around people, with all the years spent among them before you came here.",
5654,,,"We soon arrived at Sivney's Private Lab. I knocked on the door, then let ourselves in.",
5655,,Sivney,Who could it be...Senpai? Nice of you to visit me on this fine day. And you brought Monica with you too! Hello there.,
5656,,Monica,"Nice to meet you, Dr. Sivney.",
5657,,Sivney,"So what's the matter? You don't visit me unless you need a favor, Senpai.",
5658,,*,"Hey, hey, I just don't want to disturb you when you're working. If I had a choice, I'd be making daily visits.",
5659,,Sivney,"Whatever that makes you feel at ease, Senpai.",
5660,,Monica,"Dr. Sivney, your creations played a fundamental role in the establishment of Yume Academy, and the level of technology shown in them even surpassed the greatest inventions in Human History.",
5661,,Sivney,"Well, flattery never hurts anyone, but I would appreciate it if you got to the point.",
5662,,Monica,...I am curious about what was going on in your head when they were created.,
5663,,Monica,"I met Bud Elf yesterday, and learned that she sees the world through a flower-and-plant-shaped prism. Do you have your own particular prism that you see the world with too?",
5664,,Sivney,"I can't believe you are comparing me to Bud Elf. Besides, prisms? Is this a philosophy thing that I should be aware of?",
5665,,Monica,"I apologize if I insulted you in any way, Dr. Sivney. I'd just like to know whether the thought processes of one of the brightest minds ever known in history differ from that of the regular being.",
5666,,Sivney,"Still laying on it a bit too thick, but I get your point now. Unfortunately, I've never given too much thought to it.",
5667,,Monica,"It just seems like...like you are born into this role, with all the effort-less brilliance and creativity, like a Goddess.",
5668,,Sivney,"Wait, I was similar to Bud Elf before, and now I'm a Goddess?",
5669,,Sivney,"Well, I can't deny that. Who knows, I might even surpass the Gods one day with my creations.",
5670,,Sivney,"Have you ever heard the saying ""Stay hungry, stay foolish""?",
5671,,Monica,Words from a famous entrepreneur in human society?,
5672,,Sivney,"He quoted it from somewhere else, but yes, that's the phrase I'm talking about. Basically, you have to keep on being unsatisfied with what you have, and always aim for more. For me, it's the hunger for knowledge.",
5673,,Monica,So this is what stirrs you on. Stay hungry...,
5674,,Sivney,...and stay foolish. This is a phrase that describes my condition.,
5675,,Sivney,"This curiosity...is instinctive to human beings. The effect of a certain type of hormone, the name of which I can't really remember now, makes you yearn for more.",
5676,,Sivney,I believe there is an unhealthy level of those hormones in my bloodstream.,
5677,,Sivney,"In the end, there are no ""special thought processes"" or ""unusual mindsets"" behind my creations. I follow my instincts, and somehow things get done. End of story.",
5678,,Monica,...I don't know what to say.,
5679,,Monica,"...I always thought that there were long, complicated, and intricated thought processes running in your brain, turning out the amazing contraptions and making you special. That's what I was interested in.",
5680,,Sivney,"Like I said, an unhealthy level of hormones messes with my brain.",
5681,,Sivney,"Perhaps I'm just a regular nobody without them, like a puppet with its strings cut.",
5682,,Sivney,I think you're trying to find something that doesn't exist.,
5683,,Sivney,"Bud Elf is a special kid, but we're special in different ways.",
5684,,,Monica is at a loss of what to say.,
5685,,,She apparently doesn't approve of Sivney ascribing her success to hormones.,
5686,,,"After leaving Sivney's Lab, Monica and I take a stroll under the Cherry Blossom trees on campus.",
5687,,,"The talk with Sivney doesn't clear the doubts in her head. If anything, they exacerbate them. Despite having wandered the world for hundreds of years, she is still uncertain about human nature.",
5688,,*,I remembered you saying that you like the smart and the wise when you first arrived here.,
5689,,Monica,"Yes. I have a strong dislike for the asinine, the simple-minded, or the immature.",
5690,,*,"You know, when you think of it from another angle, these traits might even be merits.",
5691,,*,Are you satisfied with Sivney's answers to your questions?,
5692,,Monica,...I don't think so. I am surprised that she attributes her complexity and her brilliancy to hormones.,
5693,,Monica,"If that's all there's to it, then all we have to do is to inject the hormones to everyone, and we'd have a bunch of genius scientists running around.",
5694,,Monica,"It doesn't sit well with me. By the way, Senpai...",
5695,,*,Yes?,
5696,,Monica,I ran into Dracula the other day. I used to believe that she was the girl that died on my watch.,
5697,,*,Did she confirm your suspicions?,
5698,,Monica,She said that I was delusional and that it was wishful thinking on my part.,
5699,,Monica,"She sounded like Dr. Sivney, now that I think about it. She said that she survived due to her instincts, that her life wasn't any more complicated than anyone else, and that she had no intentions for it to become any more complicated than it had to be in the foreseeable future.",
5700,,*,"Sounds fake, what with that ancient castle of hers, but okay.",
5701,,Monica,"I was convinced that I would be able to find what I was looking for from her, such as the complexity of human nature.",
5702,,Monica,She had lived for a long time and had been through a lot. All these experience...is bound to change someone.,
5703,,Monica,"But in the end, it's back to ""instincts"" again, isn't it?",
5704,,,Monica laughs mirthlessly.,
5705,,Monica,I was disappointed at that time. Now...I just find it ironic.,
5706,,*,"Well, the possibilities are endless, and it's impossible to classify human beings as ""complicated"" or ""simple"".",
5707,,*,"There is no ""good personality trait"" or ""bad personality trait"". There is only a ""unique personality trait"".",
5708,,Monica,"I prided myself on having a deep understanding of human beings, but I am still puzzled by individual humans.",
5709,,*,"You're on the right path to solving the puzzle, I believe.",
5710,,,"Maleficient violet mists drifted atop the small town neighboring Yume Academy. They're hard to ignore, especially when looking down from a vantage point on top of a school building.",
5711,,Monica,Chaos is gathering again. This spells trouble.,
5712,,KongMing,...This meeting is called due to the Chaos Invasion of a neighboring town.,
5713,,KongMing,"Unfortunately, we would need more intel on the situation before we can take any action.",
5714,,Aquaris,The townsfolk will suffer as preparations drag on...,
5715,,KongMing,"I understand your concerns, Aquaris, but you mustn't forget what happened the last time we moved rashly and many of our ranks were injured.",
5716,,KongMing,"Furthermore, it appears that the Chaos invasion is not in the form of Chaos beasts this time. This calls for a different approach from what we used to do.",
5717,,Monica,Where did you get the information? I thought we didn't have any.,
5718,,,"KongMing glances at Vivian, revealing her source of information. Of course, Vivian, the master of Fortune Telling.",
5719,,Vivian,"The alignment of the stars bodes evil...with the Chaos appearing this close to Campus, I doubt it's a coincidence.",
5720,,Vivian,Our enemies are not just Chaos Beasts this time. An army of robots has joined their force.,
5721,,Vivian,"An army of Chaos-corrupted robots and drones, to be exact. The Chaos this time seems to hold the ability to possess inanimate objects.",
5722,,,Monica frowns.,
5723,,Monica,How did you get your hands on this information? Did the stars just tell you everything?,
5724,,Vivian,"Yes, they do. I can glean meaning from the alignment of stars in the sky.",
5725,,Monica,"I see. However, from my perspective, they are not stars, just dots in the sky. How to interpret the shapes that the dots form is entirely up to the fortune teller, isn't it?",
5726,,Monica,"I'm saying that it's too dependent on the fortune teller, and hardly a reliable source of information.",
5727,,Vivian,"Monica, I understand that you are unfamiliar with the art of stargazing, and therefore are cautious to trust its results. But I assure you, there is a tried and trusted method to interpret the layout of the stars.",
5728,,Monica,"Perhaps, but I will stay wary of the ""readings"" you give when there are so many ways to interpret this.",
5729,,Monica,"What do you say, KongMing?",
5730,,KongMing,"Monica has a point, and I don't plan on basing our action plan on this one source of information. I will be sending trustworthy scouts to check out the area soon.",
5731,,,"Vivian pouts, obviously not happy with Monica doubting the credibility of her readings.",
5732,,Vivian,"And what about you, Monica? Do you think you are observing the truth when you reverse or speed up the flow of time, watching the events fold out with your own eyes?",
5733,,Monica,"At least closer to the truth than ""messages from stars"", I believe. I apologize if I offended you, Vivian, it's just that we work in different ways.",
5734,,Monica,"Personally, I find time-traveling to be a more stable way of gaining information.",
5735,,Monica,Stargazing is too unreliable.,
5736,,Diana,"Erm, stargazing isn't that bad. I mean, Vivian once predicted that I will meet my sister here at Yume Academy, and I'd like to believe that it's true.",
5737,,Vivian,"Have you heard about ""Butterfly Effects"", Monica? Even the smallest change in the past will cause unimaginable impacts on the future.",
5738,,Vivian,"The flow of time is in another dimension, one that we cannot control.",
5739,,Vivian,"We are too weak and powerless when faced with greater entities than us, such as the concept of time.",
5740,,Vivian,"All I try to do is to explain what the stars may want to show us, not to manipulate the stars into shaping what we want to see. Unlike what you have been doing with time, Monica, if I have to add.",
5741,,Monica,Vivian…,
5742,,,"No one dares to say a word. If a needle was dropped, the sound will reverberate in the conference room for how silent it is. Monica and Vivian glare at each other.",
5743,,Aquaris,…………,
5744,,Monica,That was…,
5745,,Aquaris,"...Awesome! Monica, can you send me to the future to see what happens to me in the future?",
5746,,Monica,Excuse me?,
5747,,Aquaris,"I mean, I can't imagine whether I will get rich first, or become a swordmaster first! Or, I don't know, become a very rich swordmaster!",
5748,,Aquaris,"Or if you can't, then I'll ask Vivian if she can ask the stars about this.",
5749,,Vivian,"What are you going on about? If you want fortune-telling services, come to my tent after we solve this Chaos invasion issue.",
5750,,Aquaris,Back to Monica it is then! Please? Pretty please?,
5751,,Aquaris,"Anyways, the one who helps me is the better fortune teller or future reader or whatever it is!",
5752,,*,"Aquaris, if you haven't noticed, we're having a serious discussion here. What brought about this anyway?",
5753,,Aquaris,They're getting nowhere with their arguments. I'm just providing a way to help!,
5754,,KongMing,"Of course, nothing but good intentions from you. But I digress.",
5755,,KongMing,"It's established that this Chaos Invasion is different from the others we've witnessed in the past, but we need more information about it.",
5756,,KongMing,"Do not lower your guard. After this meeting adjourns, I will ask a few of us to scout out the area.",
5757,,KongMing,The meeting will be reopened when they bring back intel about the situation. Any objections?,
5758,,Vivian,Nope!,
5759,,Monica,No.,
5760,,,"The tension dissolves like water before Monica realized it, and the arguments are gone without a trace.",
5761,,,The realization hits Monica like a brick and gets her thinking deeply.,
5762,,*,"Monica, are you still worried about the Chaos Invasion? I think KongMing has everything covered as usual, and nothing will go wrong.",
5763,,Monica,"That is a part of my troubles, yes, but I am mainly concerned that I almost got into an argument with Vivian.",
5764,,*,"Oh, that. Yeah, you are both smart and stubborn people. It's bound to happen sooner or later.",
5765,,*,I can't thank Aquaris enough for intervening before things escalated.,
5766,,Monica,I just realized it too.,
5767,,*,"Just as I said before, Aquaris is very kind. There is this strange aura around her that just makes you feel at peace.",
5768,,Monica,"What she said was inappropriate for a meeting, but actually helped the meeting progress further.",
5769,,Monica,I seem to have misunderstood her greatly before.,
5770,,*,"Don't worry, she won't hold it against you. I'd also say that you just learned something new about human nature now.",
5771,,Monica,I did. Aquaris is far from being simple-minded. There is a hidden depth to her that I never discovered...,
5772,,,"The Chaos Invasion spread from one town to another, and the purple mists take over more ground as the days pass by.",
5773,,,"Luckily, KongMing's plan progresses steadily, and Yume Academy now has a rough idea of what this unusual Chaos Invasion entails.",
5774,,,"To make sure the message spread fast enough, KongMing wants someone to run the Radio Station.",
5775,,,Aquaris volunteers.,
5776,,*,"Are you worried that Aquaris will mess things up this time too, Monica?",
5777,,Monica,"It's hard not to, after that fiasco with the stage lights. However, if KongMing trusts her, then I wouldn't object to her decision.",
5778,,*,"Well, I'll be there with her at the Radio Station too. I can keep an eye on her and make sure she gets the job done properly.",
5779,,Monica,"If you need any help on that front, you can come to me for help. I won't hesitate to lend a hand.",
5780,,*,I think Aquaris needs your help more than I do. She's probably still working on it now.,
5781,,*,She'd also appreciate your presence there.,
5782,,Monica,Very well. I have several questions for her myself.,
5783,,*,You? For Aquaris? This is unusual.,
5784,,Aquaris,"Hiya, Senpai! And Monica's here too!",
5785,,Aquaris,"I haven't finished tidying up the place yet, so it's a bit of a mess here. I hope you don't mind standing; all the chairs have mysteriously disappeared.",
5786,,Monica,It's alright. I'm just checking in to see how you're doing and whether you need any help.,
5787,,*,"Not gonna lie, you're doing surprisingly well so far.",
5788,,Aquaris,"All thanks to you. By the way, Monica, how's your competition with Vivian?",
5789,,*,"Wait, there's a competition going on now?",
5790,,Aquaris,"Hey, I'm just really curious to hear what they have to say about my future.",
5791,,,Monica giggles at Aquaris' antics. She is suddenly struck with a stray thought.,
5792,,Monica,"Wait, you honestly wanted us to tell your fortune on the meeting?",
5793,,Aquaris,Uh yes? Why wouldn't I?,
5794,,,"Aquaris replies, tilting her head in confusion.",
5795,,Aquaris,It's the fastest way to find out who's better. You'd never stop arguing otherwise.,
5796,,Monica,It's almost impossible to foretell the future without consequences.,
5797,,Monica,"Just as Vivian said, she can only try to glean meaning from the stars, while I cause butterfly effects by traveling through time.",
5798,,Aquaris,Oh…,
5799,,,Aquaris put her hand on her chin as she thinks.,
5800,,Aquaris,...So are there better ways to peek into the future than stargazing and time-traveling?,
5801,,Monica,"...There might be. However, they are beyond our abilities.",
5802,,,Monica stills at her revelation.,
5803,,Monica,"…So neither of us should be judging the other, right?",
5804,,Aquaris,"Uh, maybe? Why are you so serious all of a sudden?",
5805,,,Aquaris seems disconcerted by the sudden change in Monica's mood.,
5806,,,Monica smiles reassuringly at her.,
5807,,Monica,Great wisdom hides beneath a facade of stupidity...of course.,
5808,,Aquaris,"Erm, what?",
5809,,*,"That means you're the most intelligent person among us, Aquaris.",
5810,,Aquaris,"Hey, stop making fun of me!",
5811,,Aquaris (In the Radio),Reports show that the traces of Chaos detected from the neighboring towns are all stored in discarded robots and drones.,
5812,,Aquaris (In the Radio),"They were supposed to be inanimate, but are now powered by Chaos, and attack everything on sight.",
5813,,Aquaris (In the Radio),Estimations are that this is a different type of Chaos that we're used to…,
5814,,Vivian,"Did you hear that? As the stars told me, the Chaos this time is largely different from every case that we've dealt with in the past. That should be enough proof for the credibility of stargazing, Monica.",
5815,,Monica,I believe you now.,
5816,,Monica,And I apologize for my behavior in the meeting. It was uncalled for and inappropriate for the situation back then.,
5817,,Vivian,"Um, who are you and where is the real Monica? I surely didn't see that coming from you.",
5818,,Monica,Senpai called for a meeting again. We should probably get down to business.,
5819,,KongMing,I believe it's time for action now.,
5820,,KongMing,"Senpai, Monica, Vivian, Diana, Aquaris, and everyone in this room...I need your help in this battle.",
5821,,Aquaris,"You don't have to ask, KongMing. It's our duty to fight against the influence of Chaos!",
5822,,,"The Girls head out to the Chaos-infested towns,",
5823,,,where the drones wreaked havoc.,
5824,,,"What's worse, the townsfolk are inflicted by an unknown plague, one that takes away their sanity and causes them to go on a rampage…",
5825,,,...typical signs of Chaos infection.,
5826,,,"Under KongMing's lead, the Girls managed to suppress the drones, cleanse the Chaos influence from the town, and return triumphantly to Yume Academy.",
5827,,KongMing,"Thank you all for your help and efforts, ladies. Especially Monica, who has finally proven herself in battle. I hope you will be joining us in operations like these more frequently in the future.",
5828,,Monica,I...will consider it. The Chaos that we encountered this time is definitely different from what I've seen in my travels before I came to the Academy.,
5829,,Vivian,"That's because they have resurrection abilities. They don't really die in the traditional sense: when we take down one drone, the energies controlling it just disperses and comes together again to control something else.",
5830,,Vivian,"It's hard to take them down for good, if you know what I mean.",
5831,,KongMing,"That's correct, but not the only cause for those drones.",
5832,,Monica,What are the other causes?,
5833,,KongMing,"It's a tragedy. There was a breakthrough in technology, which made drone usage common in factories, and the town thrived along with its industry.",
5834,,KongMing,"The thing about drones is that they never tire, have no need for food, and carry out their assignments with inhuman accuracy.",
5835,,KongMing,"Human workers couldn't keep up, and many died from exhaustion. The despair of those workers never left the drones, and attracted the Chaos here as well.",
5836,,KongMing,Despair and Chaos merged together to form the...abominations that we fought.,
5837,,Monica,(...This sounds familiar...but where has I heard this before?),
5838,,KongMing,It was a recipe for disaster.,
5839,,KongMing,"On the outside, everything seemed to be going well, but this obviously didn't keep up. Soon, the town deteriorated into what we see now.",
5840,,Vivian,What a pity...this was a thriving town.,
5841,,KongMing,"There is...not much left of the townsfolk to rebuild the town. It might never return to its former glories, or even reach a shadow of its former self.",
5842,,KongMing,"But that must be old news to you, Monica. Even the most developed civilizations fall to ruins after reaching their peaks, as you must have witnessed on your travels.",
5843,,Monica,……,
5844,,Monica,Breakthrough in technology...drones...This is too familiar.,
5845,,Monica,...I think I remember this town.,
5846,,*,"Wow, what a coincidence! Have you lived here before?",
5847,,Monica,"Yes, but it is not the bustling town that I remembered.",
5848,,Monica,……,
5849,,,Monica turns her gaze downwards with a pensive look on her face.,
5850,,*,"...It must be hard, the reality not matching up with your memories.",
5851,,Monica,"The streets used to be filled with people and decorations...now, they are abandoned and bare. That is the way of life: everything comes to an end.",
5852,,Aquaris,That's so sad.,
5853,,Aquaris,Is there anything we can do to stop this from happening?,
5854,,Vivian,Didn't you hear Monica? It's the way of life.,
5855,,Vivian,"It's the same with the moon: after the full moon, darkness chips away at it, until it disappears from the night sky.",
5856,,Aquaris,"Erm, that sounds...ominous. Does that mean we can only sit back and wait for our ends to come or something?",
5857,,Vivian,"That depends on what you do, I'm afraid.",
5858,,*,"Monica, are you alright? You seem...distant.",
5859,,,Monica makes a poor attempt at a smile. It looks more like a grimace.,
5860,,Monica,"I'm just thinking that this is one of the few times Vivian and I agree with each other, that everything ends.",
5861,,,Her voice softens to barely a whisper.,
5862,,*,Are you worried that Yume Academy would end like this town too?,
5863,,Aquaris,What? The Academy? Please don't jinx us...,
5864,,Monica,"I wasn't implying it, just...concerned.",
5865,,Monica,The entrepreneurs I met back in the day were passionate and devoted to their work. Their successors...didn't inherit those traits.,
5866,,Monica,"It is no surprise that they were unable to continue their families' work, choosing to be spoiled by their wealth.",
5867,,KongMing,Those who dwell in their contentment meet their end quickly...a lesson well-learned.,
5868,,Monica,"I'd say so, yes.",
5869,,Aquaris,Hmm...,
5870,,*,"Aquaris thinking? That's new. What's going on in your brilliant mind, oh great philosopher of our times?",
5871,,,Aquaris pays no attention to my jab.,
5872,,,She mutters in a small voice.,
5873,,Aquaris,"So, from what we've gathered here: you can't be too content with what you have, right?",
5874,,Monica,That's the idea.,
5875,,Aquaris,"Following the same thought, as long as we don't do that, we won't be meeting our ends like the entrepreneurs in this town, right?",
5876,,KongMing,"Good thinking, Aquaris.",
5877,,Vivian,"That...actually made sense. The future isn't written in stone, and humans and the moon are largely different anyways.",
5878,,Monica,"In the end, it depends on the choices we make.",
5879,,KongMing,That's right! There's no point being worried over what hasn't happened yet.,
5880,,KongMing,"It is us that determines what the future looks like, and the Yume Academy is still young. It has endless possibilities.",
5881,,Aquaris,Yeah! Whatever KongMing said!,
5882,,,"Monica giggles at the unexpectedness of everything: before arriving at the Academy, she never would have imagined herself being surrounded by the camaraderie of the girls.",
5883,,Monica,"It looks like Aquaris solved yet another puzzle of mine, Senpai.",
5884,,*,Which one? The one about everything ending?,
5885,,Monica,"Yes. Now that I think about it, too much has happened since the War against Chaos. There are way too many things that we cannot control, including our ends.",
5886,,Monica,As long as we do everything we can within our abilities...then it should be enough.,
5887,,*,"Changed your mind on Aquaris now, eh?",
5888,,Monica,"I hate to admit it, but yes, you were right.",
5889,,*,"Uh, what did I say again?",
5890,,Monica,"Oh, you don't remember now? You said that human nature can't be summarized by ""simple"" or ""complex"",",
5891,,Monica,"and that there is no ""good personality trait"" or ""bad personality trait"".",
5892,,Monica,"There is only a ""unique personality trait"".",
5893,,*,"Yes, that sounds like me.",
5894,,*,"But hey, I'm glad you came around. Being here is a pretty eye-opening experience, isn't it?",
5895,,Monica,"It is, Senpai. It surely is.",
