Immunity is calculated differently from the control effect chances: for example, an attack with a 50% chance to restrict a girl may be possible to control a girl with 70% Immunity.||Control Rate|Increases the rate the enemy will be affected by your control skills. This status will be calculated together with the target's Immunity.||Damage Reduction|Damage Reduction reduces the amount of damage inflicted by opponents, helping your Girls to survive longer.

If it's yellow, it means this attack doesn't trigger Crit attack and the attacker is buffed by Faction Rivalry. If it's red, it means this attack is a Crit attack (the attack can be either buffed by Faction Rivalry or not). And if it's green, it's showing the healing amount.||Skill Effect|Buffs or debuffs labeled with “Skill effect” cannot be removed by Potential or Skills."
