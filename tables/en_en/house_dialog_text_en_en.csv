1,Iron Fist,KongMing senpai!!! Good morning~
2,KongMing,Good morning~
3,Dracula,"When I'm alone in this dorm, it will be mine to rule!"
4,Saint,Where's Michael? I thought you two are inseparable.
5,Lucifer,"She's got her own business, but that's not your problem."
6,Valeera,"Phoenix is right next to me, what should I say to start the topic?"
7,Phoenix,"Valeera is right next to me, what should I say to start the topic?"
8,Saint,What about a finger guess game right here?
9,Gambler,"That's a good idea! I won't lose this time! Paper, scissor, stone…"
10,Saint,Paper!
11,Gambler,Stone!
12,Librarian,I've got no book to read here… Senpai must be bragging about how he likes to read.
13,Iron Fist 1,Who are you?
14,Iron Fist 2,That's what I'm about to ask. I would never wear this!
15,Iron Fist,"Nooo… The dorm is too humble, there's not even a proper place to sleep…"
16,Iron Fist,A crystal ball? I've never seen snow before… May I get inside and have a look?
17,Lucifer,"Saint, don't you dare try to provoke me!"
18,KongMing,Iron Fist must be in a good mood today~ But…
19,Raphael,"But her prosthetic arm doesn't look good, right?"
20,Raphael,"I've noticed that too, but don't be worried, I believe she can handle this herself."
21,KongMing,I hope so…
22,Bud Elf,Senpai should decorate his dorm with more plants! I need to tell him that later~
23,Sonya,It smells great! They must have developed a new recipe!
24,Mio,Happy Meow Year?
25,Mio,Meow... This dress is too tight for me!
26,Michael,My poster? Gabriel must have sneaked another photo!!!
27,Lucifer,"Michael's poster? Haha, someone's doing a great job here!"
28,Valeera,Never knew Senpai also has a collection of storybooks.
29,Valeera,This story is really weird… The main character is so related to Iron Fist…
30,Iron Fist,A storybook? Well… The story is really interesting!
31,Ithil,Never thought this room can be so tidy.
32,Ithil,Maybe I can help to clean up this room after the next operation is over.
33,CapsuGirl,What's Senpai doing right now? Hope he's not messing up my capsule machine…
34,KongMing,"Every time I wear this dress, it reminds me of the sweet memories with Senpai..."
35,KongMing,Although I predicted this would happen... But I was still surprised that Senpai did it without hesitation.
36,Iron Fist,I'll fight hard for Senpai as always!
37,Sakura,I only hope Senpai can also see the cherry blossom here…
38,Hexa,"Everyone is fighting for justice, I don't see a point to leave me here…"
39,Saint,"So, they're out for another battle? Why they didn't take me with them!"
40,Hottie,Time to plan for my next vocation~
41,Fencer,"Warmth will affect the cast of ice magics… But since I'm not in battle, it's okay to stay here a little bit longer…"
42,Michael,"Let's take a break, and return to work once we recover. Senpai still needs our assistance!"
43,Lucifer,"Light cannot exist without darkness, but people barely recognize this fact. But I believe Senpai knows this very well…"
44,Ennmaya,I hope this room can be a little bit darker. Sadly I cannot remodel Senpai's room privately.
45,Dracula,I smell human in this room. It's been a long time since I last drunk some real human blood…
46,KongMing,It's not bad to be surprised by this.
47,Lucifer,Why do I need to take courses like others? I can become talented through self-study!
