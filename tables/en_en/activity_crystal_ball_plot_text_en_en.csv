1,An Irritating Summer,,"In this hot summer day,",
2,,,I am bored out of my mind with nothing to do.,
3,,,"I,",
4,,,"Vivian,",
5,,,am the most famous fortune teller in Yume Academy.,
6,,,You're asking why isn't there anyone coming to me for Fortune Telling?,
7,,,"I suppose it all started with the ""Lost and Found""…",
8,,Vivian,"…A ""Lost and Found""?",
9,,KongMing,Yes.,
10,,Vivian,Did I hear this right? You're asking me to find misplaced things…with fortune telling?,
11,,Kong Ming,That's right.,
12,,KongMing,Isn't that why you started your fortune telling business in the first place? To help others?,
13,,Vivian,My intention was to spread the voice of the stars. Just what any other Astrology lover will do.,
14,,KongMing,"The students are growing restless with the weather becoming warmer, and losing their belongings just make things worse…",
15,,KongMing,And that's where you come in!,
16,,Vivian,Did you listen to what I said? My intention was…,
17,,,……,
18,,,And…,
19,,,"The ""Lost and Found"" will be held in the day, right?",
20,,Vivian,When no stars are visible in the sky?,
21,,Vivian,How can I tell anyone's fortune without the stars?!,
22,,Amelia,You seem troubled. Is there anything I can help?,
23,,Vivian,You? Offering help?,
24,,Amelia,"You hurt me with your doubts. Anyways, I'm here to provide an alternative to star-gazing.",
25,,Vivian,An alternative?,
26,,Amelia,"Exactly! This tome, ""The Ultimate Handbook to Fortune Telling"", contains many methods of fortune telling, such as ""Divination with an Orb"" and ""Useful Tips when branching out into other types of Fortune Telling"". You will find it very suitable to your needs!",
27,,Vivian,"Are you sure it's a tome, and not…I don't know, a random book you picked up somewhere?",
28,,Amelia,A random book? I'll have you know that I only handle the best merchandise!,
29,,Amelia,"So, what do you think? You can get an extra Crystal Orb if you purchase it now!",
30,,,Amelia beamed at me.,
31,,,The smile was too wide to be natural.,
32,,,I sighed.,
33,,,…And paid for the tome.,
34,,Vivian,"(Reading) Why is this tome in Times New Roman 12, and double spaced?",
35,,Vivian,"Well, this WAS pretty suspicious, considering it's from Amelia…",
36,,Girl A,"Vivian, here's something for you.",
37,,,……,
38,,,"It's a Board with ""Lost and Found"" written on it…with KongMing's handwriting too.",
39,,Vivian,I wonder why is KongMing sending people my way so I can find their lost stuff…,
40,,Vivian,Are there that many misplaced items in Yume Academy?,
41,,Ithil,Hello?,
42,,Vivian,Woah!,
43,,,Someone really came…!,
44,,Vivian,"Hi, Ithil!",
45,,Ithil,"Hi, Vivian. I heard you can find misplaced objects with Fortune Telling?",
46,,Vivian,"I'm just a regular Astrology lover, but yes, I should be able to find your lost belongings.",
47,,Ithil,I lost my new pair of gloves. Could you please find them for me?,
48,,Vivian,Gloves…?,
49,,Ithil,"Yes. They're specially made, you see, and are pretty sturdy. I'd hate to lose them.",
50,,Aquaris,Vivian! I need your help!,
51,,,……,
52,,,"I know it's impossible to knock when I'm in a tent, but barging in like that is just rude.",
53,,Aquaris,"Vivian, I really need your help!",
54,,Vivian,"Queue up, I'm busy here.",
55,,Aquaris,"No, I haven't lost anything! I am looking for something you have though.",
56,,Aquaris,"I'm rehearsing a play with Valeera, and we need a Crystal Orb for it. Can I borrow it?",
57,,Vivian,…And what is that you're holding onto?,
58,,Aquaris,A Size XXXL Mercury Orb!,
59,,,……,
60,,Aquaris,"Valeera said this one won't work for us, and sent me to find something better. I came here as soon as I heard about your Crystal Orb!",
61,,Vivian,I need it for Fortune Telling too!,
62,,Aquaris,"What is this…""Divination with an Orb""?",
63,,Aquaris,Let me see…,
64,,Aquaris,"Vivian, it says on here that anything sphere-like would work! My Mercury Orb would probably work too!",
65,,Ithil,"Aquaris has a point. The a skilled sword-fighter will not weaken with a blunt blade, nor will their skills be strengthened with a sharp one. It is the user that is important, not the tool.",
66,,Ithil,"Furthermore, she seems desperate.",
67,,Aquaris,(Looks pitiful),
68,,Vivian,"Alright, if even Ithil says so. But do remember to give it back as soon as rehearsals are finished!",
69,Divination...Going Wrong,Vivian,"In the meantime, I'll use this Mercury Orb instead…",
70,,Vivian,"Hands on the Mercury Orb, please.",
71,,Ithil,Like this?,
72,,Vivian,"Exactly. After putting your hands on the Orb, think about your lost items…",
73,,Ithil,(Following instructions),
74,,,……,
75,,,……,
76,,Vivian,……,
77,,Ithil,Ten minutes have passed. Have you found them?,
78,,Vivian,…Why is the Orb not lighting up?,
79,,,Is it because of the Mercury?,
80,,Vivian,"That's not right, I think the material of the Orb does matter after all. I need to find Aquaris…",
81,,Vivian,"I'm sorry for wasting your time, Ithil.",
82,,Ithil,Don't worry about it. I probably should have tried looking for it myself before relying on Fortune Telling first. I'll see what I can do about the gloves.,
83,,Vivian,"She was very understanding, but I feel bad for letting her down…",
84,,Fenrir,Vivian!! Are you there!!,
85,,,……,
86,,,...The opening is right there. There is no need to come in from the window.,
87,,Fenrir,I heard that you can find stuff?,
88,,Vivian,"I do, but I can't guarantee that I will definitely find them.",
89,,Fenrir,"That's good enough! Vivian, I need you to make me stronger. I want to be the best warrior in the entire universe!",
90,,Vivian,"You're in the wrong place. I'd suggest the Infirmary if you need body-building advice, or if physical training works better for you, Kratos can usually be found in that direction.",
91,,Fenrir,That's exactly why I'm here: I can't beat Kratos yet!,
92,,Vivian,……,
93,,,My head hurts.,
94,,,I need to get her out of here.,
95,,Vivian,"Alright then. Put your hands on the Orb, and I'll see what I can do. I'm not 100 percent sure it will work though.",
96,,,"It didn't last time, at least.",
97,,,If it doesn't work this time too…,
98,,,Then I'm afraid there's nothing more I can do.,
99,,Fenrir,I'm ready! Let's goooooo!!!!,
100,,,Stop getting so excited over nothing…,
101,,Vivian,……,
102,,Fenrir,……,
103,,Fenrir,Are you sure this works?,
104,,Vivian,I'm not.,
105,,Fenrir,"Tsk, what a let-down.",
106,,,……,
107,,,The truth stings.,
108,,,(Ten minutes later),
109,,Raphael,"Excuse me, is anyone-Oh, Vivian, it's you. I thought you were away since no one responded. Why are you in tears?",
110,,Vivian,"Raphael, you are the only one that came in from the tent opening like a normal person so far. Pardon me for shedding some tears at the only semblance of normalcy today.",
111,,Raphael,……,
112,,Vivian,"(Wiping away tears) Anyways, how may I help you?",
113,,Raphael,Is this an inconvenient time? I can come back later…,
114,,Vivian,"No, no, I'm free now. Are you looking for your misplaced belongings too?",
115,,Raphael,"Oh, I don't need help with that, at least not now. I'm here for another matter. You see, I just had two…unusual patients, and according to them, the only thing they did differently today was coming to you.",
116,,Raphael,Would you mind telling me what happened here?,
117,,Vivian,Patients? Who would they be…?,
118,,Raphael,"(Towards the Tent opening) Come in, you two.",
119,,,Two children walked in.,
120,,,"Usually, children are the epitome of innocence, and symbolizes many good things.",
121,,,But I can't feel any of them from those two.,
122,,Vivian,…Am I hallucinating?,
123,,Raphael,"Here, this is Big Sister Viv.",
124,,Kid Ithil,Big Sister Viv!,
125,,Kid Fenrir,Big Sister Viv!,
126,,Vivian,……,
127,,,…… (Faints),
128,,Raphael,Vivian! Are you alright?! Stay with me!,
129,Can I Go Back To Sleep Now?,,My consciousness drifts in space…,
130,,,"Usually, a beam of light would shine upon me,",
131,,,and someone would call my name.,
132,,,That is how I wake up normally.,
133,,？？,Vivian…,
134,,？？？,Vivian…,
135,,,Here I come…to the voice calling to me…,
136,,Team Member A,Why is she still asleep?,
137,,Team Member B,We don't have all day!,
138,,Linky,I suppose this is the time where we pour a bucket of water on her to wake her up? It could be too late for Fenrir if she didn't wake up in time…,
139,,Vivian,"I'm up, I'm up…that was a very effective morning call.",
140,,Raphael,Good. Are you feeling well now?,
141,,Vivian,"I'm alright, thanks. Though I feel like this might change if I didn't wake up in time.",
142,,Raphael,I see. Can I ask about what happened now?,
143,,,Can I go back to sleep now?,
144,,Raphael,"I see, I see. So you changed your methods of fortune telling after taking advice from Amelia?",
145,,Vivian,That's correct.,
146,,Raphael,And then changed the Orb from Crystal to Mercury after borrowing the Crystal one to Aquaris?,
147,,Vivian,Yes…,
148,,Raphael,"So far, it seems like the change in the orbs is the most probable cause of this…",
149,,Vivian,…What makes you think it's not Amelia?,
150,,Raphael,"We'll know after testing it out. Vivian, can you tell my fortune with the Mercury Orb please?",
151,,Vivian,Are you sure? This seems pretty risky.,
152,,Raphael,I believe in you.,
153,,Vivian,O-Okay…,
154,,,What's with the sudden trust?,
155,,Vivian,"Hands on the Mercury Orb, please.",
156,,Raphael,Done.,
157,,Vivian,"Now, think about your question…",
158,,Raphael,Alright…,
159,,,……,
160,,,……,
161,,,Boom!!,
162,,,……,
163,,,"There's this saying called ""looking for trouble"".",
164,,,It fits nicely with what happens now.,
165,,,Starting with the explosion…,
166,,,The explosion…,
167,,,Explosion…,
168,,,The Mercury Orb exploded.,
169,,Vivian,My tent!,
170,,Linky,You should be worrying about something else.,
171,,Vivian,What do you mean…?,
172,,Kid Raphael,"Hello, Big Sister Viv.",
173,,Vivian,——！,
174,,,I heard that people go speechless when they are astonished.,
175,,,I am feeling pretty astonished right now.,
176,,Vivian,……？？？,
177,,Linky,At least we now know that it's because of the Mercury Orb.,
178,,Vivian,"Thank you for coming, Senpai.",
179,,*,…This is…unexpected.,
180,,Vivian,…I can explain.,
181,Cleaning Up the Mess,*,Please do.,
182,,Vivian,"You see, there's no one that wants to help…",
183,,,Ten Minutes Ago,
184,,Vivian,Project Amelia Discovery?,
185,,Vivian,You might want to consider honing your naming skills.,
186,,Linky,I will consider bodily harm if Fenrir isn't back to normal by the end of today.,
187,,,Did she just threaten me?,
188,,,It doesn't sound like she's joking...,
189,,Team Member A,"Oh, Captain! What happened to you?!",
190,,Team Member B,We can't live without you!,
191,,Vivian,"Calm down, she's still alive.",
192,,Team Member A,Please turn her back.,
193,,Team Member B,"If not, you might have to pay…in blood.",
194,,Vivian,I really shouldn't have agreed to this.,
195,,,"And since Amelia is out somewhere doing who-knows-what,",
196,,,I need help in finding her.,
197,,,Which requires some manpower.,
198,,Vivian,That's why I asked you to help.,
199,,*,……,
200,,Vivian,Pretty please? You're the best Senpai in the world!,
201,,*,"Flattery brings you nowhere, Vivian, but I'll help this time.",
202,,Vivian,"I need to find Amelia and resolve all of this. If I can get my money back, that's even better.",
203,,*,"The latter is probably more important for you, I'd say.",
204,,*,"By the way, why do we have to bring Raphael along too?",
205,,Vivian,Well…,
206,,,(Flashback),
207,,Vivian,Are you sure about this?,
208,,Team Member A,Of course! I need to look after Captain…,
209,,Linky,"In this case, I'll go with Fenrir.",
210,,Kid Raphael,"Big Sister Viv, would you come with me…?",
211,,Vivian,……,
212,,,(Flashback ends),
213,,Vivian,It's a complicated story.,
214,,*,…That's all you have to say?,
215,,Vivian,"Anyways, let's meet up with everyone else.",
216,,Linky,Is this the map? Let me see…,
217,,Linky,The Swampy Forest.,
218,,Vivian,Looks spooky.,
219,,Vivian,Why is Amelia here?,
220,,*,I heard that she gets some of her merchandise here.,
221,,Vivian,Sounds shady.,
222,,,It IS a pretty dark forest.,
223,,Vivian,"Let's split in three teams, and meet up again after finding her. By the way, why are you carrying a sack?",
224,,Linky,For stuffing her in.,
225,,Team Member A,"Don't worry, we had the specially enlarged ones. It can fit more than one regular-sized human being in it!",
226,,Vivian,……,
227,,*,Let's see. Three roads diverged in a wood…,Take the path to the left|Take the path in the middle|Take the path to the right
228,,,…and all of them are covered by vines and thorns.,
229,,Vivian,Which one should we take?,
230,,*,The one on the left looks good.,
231,,Linky,We'll take the right one then.,
232,,,…And off they went.,
233,,Team Member A,"That leaves the middle route. This way, Captain.",
234,,,…That leaves us.,
235,,Vivian,"Let's go, Senpai…Raphael.",
236,,Vivian,Urgh!,
237,,Vivian,Ahhhhhhhhhh!!!,
238,,Vivian,Ahhhh!!!! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!,
239,,*,…Can you please stop that?,
240,,Vivian,AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!,
241,,*,……,
242,,Vivian,It's a bug! A huge one! HUGE!,
243,,Vivian,A caterpillar! It's colorful! And squishy!,
244,,*,…Why are you staring at it if it scares you so much?,
245,,*,Taking in every detail too.,
246,,Vivian,AHHHHH!!!!!! Ouch! WAHHHHHHH!!!!,
247,,*,What now?,
248,,Vivian,I tripped…it hurts!,
249,,Kid Raphael,"Big Sister Viv, it's okay, I got you.",
250,,Kid Raphael,"Here, let's take care of the wound. Senpai, do you have a clean handkerchief?",
251,,*,I'm sorry…I don't.,
252,,Kid Raphael,We'll have to use leaves then.,
253,,Kid Raphael,"Big Sister Viv, I'll clean up the wound. It might hurt a little.",
254,,*,"…Vivian, why are you crying?",
255,,Vivian,…Raphael is so nice when she's little…unlike her adult form.,
256,,*,"You're easily moved, aren't you?",
257,,Kid Raphael,I'm always nice!,
258,,Kid Raphael,"I want to be the best doctor in the world after I grow up, and take care of both the physical and mental health of my patients!",
259,,Vivian,"(Sobs) Ra-Raphael, don't you forget your dream…don't turn into one of those doctors that take no heed of the feelings of their test subjects…I mean patients...",
260,,*,…Really? That's your impression of Raphael?,
261,,Vivian,Isn't that yours too?,
262,,Vivian,"Wait, I see someone familiar in the distance…",
263,,Team Member A,"Be careful, Captain.",
264,,Team Member A,There are thorns everywhere.,
265,,Kid Ithil,Thorns…do you mean the sharp plants?,
266,,Kid Ithil,Do you want a rest? I brought some snacks!,
267,,Team Member B,"Captain, it's just a short trip…you didn't need to bring this many snacks!",
268,,Team Member B,Is that a TEA SET?!,
269,,Kid Ithil,I want to be prepared for everything!,
270,,Team Member A,"Yes, but…",
271,,Team Member B,"…a tea set is a bit too much, don't you think?",
272,,Kid Ithil,"Come on, let's take a rest. Would you like a picnic? Resting helps you go further!",
273,,Team Member A,Is this the Captain we know?,
274,,Team Member B,The Captain never said anything like this…,
275,,Kid Ithil,Tightly-strung strings will break easily. It's the same with people!,
276,,Team Member A,What happened to Captain to make her act like that as a grown up…,
277,,Team Member B,She never rested…,
278,,Team Member A,"It must be because of us…Captain did everything for us, so she has no time to relax…",
279,,Team Member B,We need to work harder! I want to help Captain too!,
280,,,They seem oddly determined.,
281,,Kid Ithil,"Being determined is good, but tea is getting cold…",
282,,Chaos Monster,Roar!,
283,,Kid Ithil,What's that?,
284,,Team Member A,"Captain, stay behind me!",
285,,Team Member B,It's enormous! Can you take on it yourself?,
286,,Team Member A,Ugh!,
287,,,Blood flowed from the wound.,
288,,Team Member A,It's…strong…,
289,,Team Member B,"Captain! This way, I'll stay back and distract it!",
290,,Kid Ithil,"Don't worry, I got this.",
291,,Team Member B,Captain…!,
292,,,Woosh!,
293,,Kid Ithil,I think I defeated it?,
294,,Team Member B,"Captain changed a lot after turning into a child, but she is strong as usual…",
295,,Team Member A,Ugh…,
296,,Kid Ithil,You're bleeding!,
297,,Team Member A,"Don't worry, it's just a scratch.",
298,,Kid Ithil,I can't protect anyone if I'm weak…,
299,,Kid Ithil,That's it! I need to train more!,
300,,Team Member A,……,
301,,Team Member B,…Perhaps it is indeed our fault that Captain never rested…,
302,,Team Member A,"…Captain takes responsibility for all of Yume Academy, I think, not just us. Hey, is that a person over there?",
303,,Team Member B,It's oddly familiar…,
304,,Team Member A,It's Amelia!,
305,,Linky,The others are gone.,
306,,Kid Fenrir,What did you say?,
307,,Linky,Nothing. Let's get going.,
308,,Kid Fenrir,"By the way, why did you choose this path?",
309,,Linky,This one?,
310,,Linky,A gut feeling.,
311,,Linky,Before this…I always followed the footsteps of Kratos.,
312,,Linky,I never doubted her choices.,
313,,Linky,But when she's not around to guide me…I want to choose the right path too. Like she always does.,
314,,Kid Fenrir,…Sounds complicated.,
315,,Linky,You won't understand. It's natural when you believe in something or someone.,
316,,Chaos Monster,Roar!,
317,,Linky,Take this!,
318,,Kid Fenrir,You took it down with one strike…,
319,,Kid Fenrir,You are a lot stronger than I thought.,
320,,Linky,When you believe in something…power flows naturally. Kratos…she is even stronger than I am.,
321,,Kid Fenrir,"If I believe in something, can I be as powerful as you?",
322,,Linky,Of course. Perhaps…even stronger than me.,
323,,Kid Fenrir,Okay! I want to be strong too!,
324,,Linky,"Believe in the right thing and you will fear nothing, not even death.",
325,,Kid Fenrir,Fearless of death…cool!,
326,,Kid Fenrir,"Look, there's someone over there!",
327,,Linky,…Amelia?,
328,That's The End...?,Amelia,I'd like some explanations.,
329,,*,"Calm down, calm down.",
330,,*,At least there's no blood spilled…yet.,
331,,Amelia,Try being tied up yourself. What's with the sacks anyway?,
332,,Vivian,Amelia! I was looking for you!,
333,,,(After some long explanations),
334,,Amelia,So…you switched to a Mercury Orb?,
335,,Vivian,"Yes, I did. Do I have to use a Crystal one to use the spells inscribed in the tome?",
336,,Amelia,I didn't expect that. I might need to adjust some incantations…,
337,,Vivian,"…Wait, ""adjust""? I thought this was an ancient tome you found? Return my money!!",
338,,Amelia,Don't pull my hair!,
339,,Team Member A,Stop fighting! Right now!,
340,,Amelia,……,
341,,Vivian,……,
342,,*,Stopping now. You can put the sword down.,
343,,Team Member A,Turn Captain back now! She can't stay as a kid forever!,
344,,Vivian,"That's right, you need to fix this.",
345,,Amelia,"Give me a minute…the nature of the spell…no, that doesn't matter. All you need to know is that the effects of the spell will wear off when today ends.",
346,,Amelia,"It was an easy spell, so changing the medium will cause it to misfunction. I suppose turning adults to children is it misfunctioning…though there might be other effects.",
347,,Vivian,I paid…for a simple spell?,
348,,Team Member A,I'm so relieved…Captain should be back to normal in no time.,
349,,Team Member B,"You have to admit, she's pretty cute as a kid.",
350,,Vivian,"You really like your Captain, don't you?",
351,,*,……,
352,,,The day finally ended.,
353,,Vivian,"New day, new pain. Why do I have to keep doing this without any guidance from the stars?",
354,,Ithil,Vivian.,
355,,Vivian,I-Ithil! You're back to normal!,
356,,Ithil,I heard that I caused a lot of trouble.,
357,,Vivian,"It's nothing…it's all my fault, anyway.",
358,,Vivian,"If anything, I need to apologize for causing you inconvenience.",
359,,Raphael,"Vivian, are you there?",
360,,Vivian,Raphael!,
361,,Raphael,How are you doing? I bring word from KongMing.,
362,,Vivian,"I'm fine, thanks…how about you?",
363,,Raphael,"Same. KongMing said that you can stop doing the ""Lost and Found"" now.",
364,,Vivian,Really?,
365,,Vivian,But…why?,
366,,Raphael,Since KongMing found her lost bottle of Sweet Chili Sauce.,
367,,Vivian,？？？,
368,,Raphael,"You see, those are very special sauce…but the bottle was stolen by wild kittens.",
369,,Raphael,She sort of lost it after that.,
370,,Vivian,And…?,
371,,Raphael,She asked everyone to help. I thought you knew that too? Since you were helping with this type of things and all.,
372,,Vivian,"She could have come to me directly... there was no need for the ""Lost and Found""!",
373,,Raphael,"Apparently, she wanted you to have some practice before actually helping her with this. But as she found it already, there's no need for you to keep doing this, isn't it?",
374,,Vivian,……,
375,,,That's a side of KongMing I didn't know about.,
376,,,"Besides,",
377,,,was this even necessary?,
378,,,"I could have just asked the stars, and all would have been well...",
379,,Raphael,"Well, everything is alright in the end, isn't it?",
380,,Vivian,That's true.,
381,,Vivian,I'm also never doing this again.,
