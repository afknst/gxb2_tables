1,Scavenger Hunt,Valeera,The starting pistol and referee whistle are ready... Everything seems to be working just fine.,
2,,Valeera,"So, the first event is... Scavenger Hunt.",
3,,Valeera,This is my first step to becoming a great referee.,
4,,Valeera,"Attention everyone, I will announce the rules of Scavenger Hunt right now!",
5,,Valeera,"First, each participant will come over and take a badge. On the badge, you will see the image of the item you need to find.",
6,,Valeera,"Once you've successfully ""borrowed"" the required item, you can cross the finish line and end your race. The rankings will be based on how much time it takes for you to find your item.",
7,,Aquaris,"Valeera, can you at least give us a hint about the objects we have to find?",
8,,Valeera,"Sorry, that won't be possible. All I can tell you is that anything you can imagine might appear on the badge.",
9,,Valeera,"So, even if you think you're ready... It might still be extremely hard for you to succeed.",
10,,Aquaris,Huh?! That sounds extremely tough.,
11,,Iron Fist,"Well, we should try our best.",
12,,Valeera,Please line up here and take your badges. You will have 2 minutes to prepare before the hunt starts.,
13,,Aquaris,???... Is this a joke?!?!,
14,,,Aquaris shouted once she got her badge.,
15,,Iron Fist,Aquaris? What is it?,
16,,Aquaris,It... It's already impossible for me to finish. I wish you the best of luck.,
17,,Hottie,"Actually, Aquaris, you're very lucky. This is a pretty easy object to obtain.",
18,,Aquaris,"Hottie... I don't feel lucky having to ""borrow"" Joan's twin blades.",
19,,Aquaris,It's already hard enough for me to make small talk with her.,
20,,Hottie,"Despite the fact that Joan is kind of hard to get along with, I think there's a good chance you could still borrow her blades.",
21,,Aquaris,Do you mean... some of the objects are even harder to get?,
22,,Hottie,"Not by much, but there might be a higher degree of difficulty. I'm sure we'll find out looking at everyone's faces.",
23,,,"As predicted, most of the contestants had panic written on their faces.",
24,,Student A,Uh... This is Ithil's eye mask... How can anybody possibly get that?,
25,,Student B,"You're lucky. I need to find some black feathers, which means I will have to go to House Demon...",
26,,Aquaris,"Hottie, you were right! I'm pretty well off compared to them...",
27,,Aquaris,"By the way, Iron Fist, what do you need to find?",
28,,Iron Fist,"KongMing's fan. That should be easy, I think.",
29,,Aquaris,That's the jackpot! It's an easy job for you!,
30,,Iron Fist,I just saw KongMing at the rostrum...,
31,,Aquaris,"Well, I guess there's no doubt that you'll win first place...",
32,,Valeera,"Alright, I think everyone's got their badge. Ready, Set... GOOOOO!!!",
33,,,Sapphire was the only contestant who didn't rush off when the race began.,
34,,,She simply walked across the finish line without finding anything.,
35,,Valeera,"Sapphire, 58 Seconds!",
36,,Student A,How could that be? She didn't even borrow anything. How does that count as a success?!,
37,,Valeera,Sapphire finished the hunt because the item she needed to borrow was her fox.,
38,,Student B,Wait??? That's way too lucky!,
39,,Student B,Talk about dumb luck...,
40,,Sapphire,The badge is given by the judge. How can anyone cheat under her supervision?,
41,,Student A,But you're from the same House. She must have fixed the competition for you.,
42,,Sapphire,I wouldn't do anything like this and neither would Valeera. It's totally beneath her.,
43,,Ithil,I added this badge. Does anyone have a problem with that?,
44,,Student B,Huh?! President Ithil?,
45,,Aquaris,Is it just me or is it winter already?,
46,,Ithil,"The badge Sapphire received was picked randomly, just like the ones you got. I assure you that Sapphire's fox IS one of our selected objects.",
47,,Ithil,Sapphire was just lucky enough to get that badge.,
48,,Ithil,And it wouldn't be this easy if others got the badge.,
49,,Ithil,"In conclusion, there's no possibility of cheating.",
50,,Ithil,I would suggest that you concentrate on the competition before you lose out in second place.,
51,,,"As Ithil was speaking, Iron Fist crossed the finish line with KongMing's fan.",
52,,Valeera,"Uhh, thanks for the help, Ithil.",
53,,Ithil,A proper judge should be able to handle this kind of matter alone.,
54,,Valeera,You're right! I will put more effort into this.,
55,,Sapphire,"I'm sorry, Valeera. It's my fault you received this criticism...",
56,,Valeera,That's not your fault. I will still say congratulations for winning first place.,
57,,Sapphire,Please then take this badge in return for such praise.,
58,,Valeera,Why? I don't think my praise is worth that much.,
59,,Sapphire,"This is a meaningful item, and I'd like to see it in good hands...",
60,,Sapphire,Besides... I think your ears look similar to the ones on my fox~,
61,,Ithil,That's because Valeera is a fo---,
62,,Valeera,Ithil! Hush!,
63,Baseball Match,Valeera,"Wow! Baseball is extremely popular on campus, Aquaris, just like you told me~",
64,,Valeera,The audience here is almost triple the size of the audiences in other competitions!,
65,,Aquaris,I won't deny that most of the audience is here for Guan Yin.,
66,,Valeera,"You mean the one they call the ""Goddess of War""? I haven't had a chance to meet her yet.",
67,,Aquaris,"Guan Yin is renowned for her prowess in the martial arts, and she has fans all over the Academy.",
68,,Valeera,Sounds like you are in her fan club.,
69,,Aquaris,"Of course! Like I said, ""all over the Academy"".",
70,,Aquaris,I heard Guan Yin will stay in the stadium for a while after the competition is over to teach us baseball.,
71,,Aquaris,This is our chance to see her up close or even take a photo with her! I believe most of the students here are waiting just for this.,
72,,Valeera,So it will get very crowded. I'd better return at once after my job is finished.,
73,,Aquaris,This is the perfect chance to meet Guan Yin face-to-face! Maybe I can even get her autograph…,
74,,Valeera,I never realized you could be such a fangirl...,
75,,Valeera,"Let me check the file... Player list, score chart... Okay, everything's ready.",
76,,Valeera,The baseball game starts... Now!!!,
77,,,And the match commenced...,
78,,,The game ended with Guan Yin earning homerun after homerun.,
79,,,"After the match ended, Guan Yin and her teammates went back to the locker room and prepared for their baseball lesson.",
80,,Valeera,"Just as Aquaris predicted, Guan Yin totally dominated the field.",
81,,Valeera,Today's work will end soon. I might be able to spend more time in the library!,
82,,,The noise of the baseball field got louder and louder as the crazy fans flooded in to see their idol.,
83,,Student A,Guan Yin! Look over here!,
84,,Student B,Excellent performance today! You're the pride of House Human!,
85,,Valeera,Looks like baseball class is about to start. I should get out of here while I still can.,
86,,Valeera,Wait... I'm missing something...,
87,,Valeera,The score chart! I need to have all the contestants sign that sheet...,
88,,Valeera,"Awwww, how can I even get close to Guan Yin in this kind of situation?",
89,,,It would have been almost impossible for Valeera to get through the crowd.,
90,,Valeera,"But according to the rules, I have to make all the contestants confirm the results within an hour after the match finishes.",
91,,Valeera,"Whelp, there's nothing for it... You got this, Valeera!",
92,,,"After calming herself down, Valeera rushed into the crowd.",
93,,Valeera,Make way...(pants)... Please make way... I have something important for Guan Yin...,
94,,Student A,Huh? Do you feel something? Something fluffy just passed by me.,
95,,Student B,Don't worry about it! Guan Yin just looked in our direction~,
96,,Student A,"What, I just missed it?",
97,,Valeera,"(panting)... Finally, there's some light…",
98,,Valeera,Just need to go a little further...,
99,,Valeera,"Guan Yin, please sign your name on this document. It's the...",
100,,,Valeera held out the score chart to Guan Yin.,
101,,,She would be able to leave this place as soon as Guan Yin signed her name. She'd even had an escape plan ready to go.,
102,,Guan Yin,"Valeera, as the referee, you didn't have to go through so much trouble to get my autograph!",
103,,Valeera,What are you talking about? I just need you to...,
104,,,"Before Valeera can claim her innocence, Guan Yin took her own photo out from the file.",
105,,Student A,Even the referee is attracted by Guan Yin's charm!,
106,,Valeera,How can it be? I meant to bring a score chart instead of a photo...,
107,,,"Before Valeera finished her sentence, she remembered her conversation with Aquaris before the match started.",
108,,Aquaris,"Valeera! Here's a photo of Guan Yin, can you keep it for me? I will need it later.",
109,,Valeera,She put this inside my folder.,
110,,Valeera,"Guan Yin, I'm only here to have you sign on the score chart. You don't have to...",
111,,Guan Yin,Don't have to do what?,
112,,Guan Yin,Here's the score chart and the photo! I've signed both of them for you~,
113,,Valeera,Oh... thanks.,
114,,Valeera,I don't think Aquaris will ever get this photo back from me.,
115,Volleyball Match,Valeera,The volleyball match is about to begin...,
116,,Valeera,(panting)... I need to reach the stadium in time.,
117,,Valeera,Barely made it. A referee should never be late for her own matches!,
118,,Valeera,Looks like everyone is here. Let's begin sign-up at once.,
119,,Students,Got it!,
120,,Valeera,"First, we have the Ghost Team: Sapphire, Ennmaya... Good, looks like the students from my House are all ready~",
121,,Sapphire,"Maybe it's too early to say this, but wish us luck in this match~",
122,,Gambler,Sapphire asked us to train a lot just for this match...,
123,,Sapphire,You didn't have to tell Valeera that.,
124,,Valeera,I believe your efforts will pay off~,
125,,Ithil,I'd take it back if I were you. It's too early to tell for sure.,
126,,Valeera,"Huh? Ithil, are you here to cheer your team on?",
127,,Valeera,I don't think the girls from your House will appreciate it so much...,
128,,Valeera,Wait... Are you wearing... a volleyball uniform?!,
129,,Ithil,"As the president of House Human, it's vital for me to set an example for the students.",
130,,Valeera,"But, isn't that unfair to the girls of other Houses?",
131,,Ithil,Well... it's not too late for you to sign up~,
132,,Valeera,That's not an option! I'm the referee of this match!,
133,,Ithil,"I see you've given up your chance~ Besides, if the match was not fair with you as its referee, I won't consider it something useful at all.",
134,,Valeera,You know that's not what I mean...,
135,,Ithil,"So, Referee Valeera, is sign-in finished?",
136,,Valeera,Yes... Please enter the court.,
137,,,Valeera sighed as the team of House Human enters the volleyball court.,
138,,Sapphire,"What's wrong, Valeera?",
139,,Valeera,Oh... Don't worry about me. You just get out there and do your best. The match is about to begin.,
140,,Valeera,I believe you will do well in this match... As long as Ithil's team doesn't go against you too soon.,
141,,Gambler,Should we really be that scared?,
142,,Gambler,"I know that Ithil is an expert knife thrower, but ball games are something totally different.",
143,,Valeera,You will soon find out...,
144,,Valeera,"No matter what, don't try to block Ithil's strikes! Be careful out there!",
145,,Sapphire,We'll take that to heart.,
146,,,"Whether it was the Valeera's prayer or pure luck, the teams from House Ghost and House Human didn't meet until the finals.",
147,,,"With Sapphire at the lead,  her team successfully entered the finals.",
148,,,"And Team Human entered... as ""Team Ithil"".",
149,,Gambler,That was so close...,
150,,Sapphire,"It's just like Valeera said: Ithil might be very strong, but maybe we can catch the next one if we react more quickly.",
151,,Ithil,I strongly advise against that. It won't end well for you.,
152,,,Ithil tossed the ball to the sky and prepared to spike.,
153,,Valeera,"If Sapphire tries to block this, she will get really hurt!",
154,,Valeera,I must save her!,
155,,,"""TWWEEEEETTTT"" went the referee's whistle.",
156,,,"Distracted by the whistle, Sapphire failed to hit the volleyball.",
157,,,"When she realizes what's happening, the ball had exploded due to the force of the impact.",
158,,Gambler,"If it wasn't for Valeera's whistle, Sapphire might have broken her arms...",
159,,Valeera,The match is over.,
160,,Valeera,Team Human wins by a score of 25:0.,
161,,Ithil,Too easy. I hope you will appear in the rival team next time.,
162,,Valeera,Referee fits me better.,
163,,Valeera,"But even if I join the match, you will still win.",
164,,Ithil,You can still give it a shot. I won't hit the ball this hard if it is you.,
165,,Valeera,Come again???,
166,Soccer Match,,Valeera's peaceful morning was once again ruined by her alarm clock.,
167,,Valeera,Can't believe I volunteered for this...,
168,,Valeera,"Come on, Valeera! You can do this!",
169,,Esau,Valeera... Why are you still here? The soccer match is about to start~,
170,,Valeera,Aiyee!! I'm soooo late!!,
171,,Valeera,This is too hard for me. Maybe I should let them find someone else.,
172,,Esau,But you've done so well up to this point. Why is soccer any different?,
173,,Jacob,"If you have to name one difference, a soccer stadium is bigger~",
174,,Valeera,Much bigger. It's super big!,
175,,Valeera,And soccer involves lots of running.,
176,,Valeera,"As a referee, I also have to run with the players...",
177,,Valeera,That's too much for me!,
178,,Jacob,Now that you mentioned it... I'm amazed that you've never had a growth spurt...,
179,,Valeera,"That's mean! This is what makes you a demon, Jacob…",
180,,Esau,"Please don't worry, Valeera. That's why I'm here with Jacob.",
181,,Esau,"Considering your low stamina, you might not be able to finish the match as a referee. We've been assigned as your deputies.",
182,,Esau,"If you feel really tired, we can take over.",
183,,Valeera,Really? That's very nice of you~,
184,,Valeera,But I should warn you that it's a tough job. I hope you're both prepared for it.,
185,,Jacob,"We've got our wings... Besides, we could survive Sonya's non-rest-dish-washing campaign without feeling tired...",
186,,Valeera,"You make a failed dine-and-dash sound legendary... But still, I'm jealous of your wings...",
187,,Esau,"Let's forget about the dine-and-dash part. We still have a long way before we reach the stadium, so let's head out at once.",
188,,,The match went off without a hitch. Everyone was having a great time…,
189,,,…Except Valeera.,
190,,Valeera,(gasp)... Finally... It's over...,
191,,Valeera,"Esau, Jacob... I will leave the rest to you. Don't let us down!",
192,,Esau & Jacob,Don't worry~,
193,,,"They tried their best, but things got worse.",
194,,Jacob,"Sister, did No.11 on the blue team just take out a wrench from her pocket?",
195,,Esau,That's too big to hide in a pocket. You must be seeing things.,
196,,Jacob,"Sister, she's trying to knock down No.7 from the red team with that wrench...",
197,,Esau,I'm telling you it's not gonna happen.,
198,,Jacob,"Sister, No.7 has a big bruise on her forehead...",
199,,Esau,Huh? I don't think that's allowed... Let me check the rules first.,
200,,Jacob,"Section 8, Clause 6 states that wounding with intent to maim is forbidden.",
201,,Esau,"HEY!!! Blue team No. 11, please stop hitting other players! Otherwise, I'm... I'm going to...",
202,,Esau,I'm going to do… what?... Let me check the rules again...,
203,,,"Before Esau figured out an answer, the referee's whistle went off and Valeera returned to the field with a red card in hand.",
204,,Valeera,"Blue team No. 11, you're out.",
205,,Esau,"Oh... Thank you, Valeera...",
206,,Jacob,I thought that being a referee would be a lot easier.,
207,,Valeera,Save it for later.,
208,,Valeera,First... Can you carry me around? I can't run anymore...,
209,,Esau & Jacob,Of course. Please consider us your wings~,
210,,,"With the help of Esau & Jacob, Valeera's legs finally had some relief.",
211,,Valeera,Thank goodness I had you two! The match might not have gone as smoothly otherwise…,
212,,Valeera,But... It seems that I'm not a suitable referee for soccer matches...,
213,,Esau,That's not true! You're the best referee we could have!,
214,,Jacob,Sister... Don't forget to give that thing to Valeera...,
215,,Esau,Oh! Please take this! The organizing committee wants you to have this.,
216,,Valeera,Is this...? A certificate for Senior Referee! They finally decide to give this to me?,
217,,Jacob,The committee hereby grants you this certificate for your remarkable performance as a referee in the past matches.,
218,,Valeera,This feels so nice!,
219,,Esau & Jacob,Please keep up the good work!,
220,,Valeera,I will!,
221,Diving,Aquaris,"Yoo-Hoo! Good morning, Valeera!",
222,,Valeera,Morning! What are you doing here? I thought you have some other projects today.,
223,,Valeera,Wait... You want me to fix your score from the Scavenger Hunt?!,
224,,Aquaris,What makes you think that?,
225,,Aquaris,I'm here because… because…,
226,,Valeera,Because WHAT?,
227,,Aquaris,"For the diving competition, of course!! Even Michael signed up for it.",
228,,Aquaris,I can't wait to see everyone in a swim suit.,
229,,Aquaris,"And the referee's seat has a perfect view of the diving pool, so I want to come with you.",
230,,Valeera,"Well, I surely can spare a seat for you... But isn't that something only Senpai would do?",
231,,Aquaris,I only want the best view for… admiring the diving talent of our classmates.,
232,,Valeera,"Yes, that's TOTALLY why you want to sit in the referee's seat...",
233,,Valeera,"But never mind, let's just get seated before the match starts.",
234,,Aquaris,Okay... But are you sure you want to bring this book with you? It might get splashed by the water...,
235,,Valeera,Just to keep me busy during the matches...,
236,,Valeera,"Besides, Yellow asked to bring him with me today.",
237,,Valeera,Never thought a book can have its own thoughts after being affected by my mana.,
238,,Aquaris,"Uh... Yellow? You didn't just name it by the color of its cover, did you?",
239,,Aquaris,I think I can protect us from the water with my umbrella.,
240,,,"When Valeera and Aquaris reached the natatorium, it was already filled with an audience.",
241,,Aquaris,It really was a great idea to come with you. Otherwise my view might be blocked by the crowd...,
242,,Valeera,Everyone has their eyes on the competition...,
243,,Aquaris,"Yes, including your book.",
244,,,The competition was fierce. Every contestant tried their best with each dive to surpass the previous divers.,
245,,,"Even before Michael ascended the diving board, the audience had already been cheering endlessly.",
246,,Valeera,"Aquaris, sit down. Remember that you're still in the referee's seat.",
247,,Aquaris,But it's so rare to see Michael swimming. If only I could get a little bit closer…,
248,,Valeera,Maybe you can see her again when she's in the locker room.,
249,,Valeera,"But for now, stay seated where you are.",
250,,Valeera,"By the way, have you seen Yellow?",
251,,Aquaris,Yellow is right over there...,
252,,,"Aquaris pointed to the rear of the referee's seat, the closest spot to the diving tower.",
253,,,Yellow was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Michael had just taken the plunge and splashed some water on the poor book.,
254,,,Valeera lept out of her seat to grab her soaked book.,
255,,Valeera,Yellow... You must be more careful! You will be ruined if you get too wet...,
256,,Valeera,… Even if you want to watch Michael up close...,
257,,,"Before Valeera could finish her sentence, Yellow jumped up from her hands and performed a full frontflip as it dove into the pool.",
258,,Aquaris,Even a book has become a Michael fangirl... I'd call that a diehard.,
259,,Aquaris,Maybe I can also try that next time!,
260,,Valeera,Yellow can complete that kind of maneuver with such a meager amount of mana?,
261,,Valeera,There might be some secrets hiding inside it...,
262,,Aquaris,Valeera... Maybe you would like to investigate its secrets later... Yellow is about to get water-logged...,
263,,Valeera,Oh- I almost forgot...,
264,Archery Competition,Student B,I heard that Amazon will join this competition~,
265,,Student A,Huh... It's been a long time since we last saw her... How do you know she will show up?,
266,,Student B,"She's still the best marksman on campus, so I've been keeping an eye out for her...",
267,,Student A,"What do you know? Tell me, tell me!",
268,,Student B,They say Amazon has been training in secret for this competition for a long time. I found a lot of broken arrows and apple cores in her dorm.,
269,,Student A,That's strange... How are apple cores helpful for archery training?,
270,,Valeera,"As the best archers on campus, I'm pretty sure you know the rules of this competition well.",
271,,Valeera,But this time the rules have been changed to better test your reaction speed and accuracy.,
272,,Valeera,This competition will incorporate moving targets.,
273,,Valeera,"After the competition begins, these targets will appear from all directions, so keep your eyes open.",
274,,Valeera,"Now, let's begin.",
275,,Aquaris,Moving targets? This competition will be a lot harder than before!,
276,,Iron Fist,I believe the match is a better test of our abilities because everyone is caught off guard.,
277,,Aquaris,But I'm not good at archery at all...,
278,,Aquaris,They just signed me up because there was no one else!,
279,,Iron Fist,"Don't worry, at least your House has the best marksman on campus.",
280,,Iron Fist,She doesn't seem panicked at all.,
281,,Aquaris,That's because her daily training uses moving targets as well. This competition is her heart's calling.,
282,,Iron Fist,What did you use for targets? Hope you didn't steal from the Animal Welfare Club.,
283,,Iron Fist,How do you know about her training routine?,
284,,Aquaris,As her assistant. I assure you that no animal was hurt during target practice... we used apples...,
285,,Aquaris,I just toss the apples up one by one so they become moving targets.,
286,,Iron Fist,Apples? Sounds like they would be really hard to hit.,
287,,Aquaris,For me? Yes. I have to eat the apples after they are used...,
288,,Aquaris,Thinking about apples makes me want to throw up...,
289,,Iron Fist,"Okay, let's just concentrate. The targets will appear very soon.",
290,,,"No sooner had Iron Fist finished speaking that a target appeared Under Amazon's keen eye, the target was pierced by her arrowed and destroyed.",
291,,Iron Fist,Has she always been such a good shot?,
292,,Aquaris,"Yes, she can even control the power of each of her shots.",
293,,Aquaris,"During training, she shot each apple with less power, slicing them into small pieces... For me to eat.",
294,,Aquaris,"I think now she's increasing the power of her shots so that they destroy the targets, robbing her competitors of a chance for points.",
295,,Iron Fist,How long has she been training?,
296,,Aquaris,Maybe a month...,
297,,Aquaris,Why do you ask?,
298,,Iron Fist,I'm afraid Amazon has already developed an unhealthy habit.,
299,,Aquaris,Do you mean... She might unconsciously try to shoot any apple that comes into her sight?,
300,,Iron Fist,That's right... Which means Valeera might be in danger. She's trying to eat an apple!,
301,,,Amazon notched an arrow in her bow when she saw the little red fruit.,
302,,,She didn't realize what she had done until her arrow had was already loosed.,
303,,Amazon,"Oh no! Valeera, get down!",
304,,Valeera,Eh???,
305,,,"Even though Amazon was pretty sure her arrow would pierce through the apple, her eyes were wide with fear.",
306,,,She gasped as Valeera cast the apple aside and summoned an ice-wall to block the arrow.,
307,,,"Luckily, the arrow altered it's course towards the apple itself as it flew through the air.",
308,,,All of a sudden the arrow sliced through the apple and hit the wall. Slices of apple flew into Valeera's hands.,
309,,Valeera,"Still a bulls-eye, even after the target changed its course. This is amazing.",
310,,Amazon,It's just the instinct of a marksman. I don't deserve any credit on that one...,
311,,Amazon,"Also, sorry for almost killing you.",
312,,Valeera,Don't worry too much. That kind of attack isn't much trouble for me. That's why I'm a senior in the first place.,
313,,Valeera,But… I have to disqualify you for assaulting a judge.,
314,,Amazon,"... My apologies, I'll take my leave.",
315,,Valeera,"Wait! Before you leave, please take this medal. You might be disqualified, but I can't think of anyone more qualified than you to have this.",
316,,Valeera,And... I'd like to keep this apple as a souvenir.,
317,,Amazon,"Of course... If you need, I can make a few more for you…",
318,,Valeera,"Nonono, don't trouble yourself... Otherwise, it will be a waste... I don't have a big belly.",
319,,Aquaris,Why do I feel someone's been talking behind my back...?,
320,Jousting Tournament,Valeera,Huh? Jousting? What's THIS doing on the list?,
321,,Valeera,But... I don't have a horse. Maybe I should sit this one out~,
322,,Esau,You don't need a horse for the match! It's more like a chicken fight!,
323,,Jacob,"A team of four will work together, with three girls carrying a fourth who wears a headband.",
324,,Jacob,The students below may not use their arms or hands and must rely on momentum to charge into the other team.,
325,,Jacob,The team is defeated if they are knocked over or if their headband is removed by an opponent.,
326,,Valeera,"Wow, you sound like quite the expert~",
327,,Valeera,"I apologize, but I'm too weak to carry anything or anyone heavy. They also forbid the use of magic~",
328,,Valeera,I would probably not be able to help you.,
329,,Jacob,"Sister, Valeera's got a point. Even if she's the one with the headband, her arms are too short...",
330,,Esau,Jacob! You could stand to be more subtle...,
331,,Esau,"Valeera, don't get too discouraged. Sometimes the runt of the litter will also prevail in this kind of match.",
332,,Jacob,"Sister, your words are harsher than mine...",
333,,Valeera,"Don't worry, you're just being honest~ I suggest you choose someone else~",
334,,Valeera,"You're already one step ahead as twins in the match, so don't waste your chance on me.",
335,,Esau,Too bad... We will go and find someone else.,
336,,Valeera,I wonder if Ithil has signed up for this. If she can be my teammate...,
337,,Ithil,So you will sign up if I'm on your team?,
338,,Valeera,"Hey! Of course, the experience will be unforgettable!",
339,,Valeera,And you will be a distraction for our opponents.,
340,,Ithil,"Okay, let's team up then!",
341,,Valeera,But we need 4 students to form a team. We need two more...,
342,,Valeera,Maybe we can recruit Esau and Jacob! They're looking for teammates too.,
343,,Ithil,"Don't bother, we just need one more teammate and the Twins are inseparable.",
344,,Valeera,You mean Turin?... But we still need one more.,
345,,Turin,…Looks like we've got a volunteer.,
346,,Ithil,I'm guessing... Kratos?,
347,,Kratos,This sounds too fun for me to pass up.,
348,,Kratos,Maybe I can even collect some useful intel during the match.,
349,,Turin,I'll be keeping an eye on you.,
350,,Ithil,Intel... What are you planning this time?,
351,,Kratos,"Relax~ At least my plan didn't kill you, right? You're still alive and that's what matters in the first place.",
352,,Kratos,"Besides, no one could plan trouble on such a good day.",
353,,Ithil,You're still under high-grade supervision. We cannot accept you.,
354,,Kratos,I wouldn't join you if you didn't have Turin with you.,
355,,Kratos,I won't let anyone hurt Turin in this savage Joust.,
356,,Turin,I don't need such protection. Just leave us alone.,
357,,Valeera,"Even if we let her in, we need to hide her identity least she causes any kind of panic.",
358,,Kratos,We can improvise. No one will recognize me with a mask on my face.,
359,,Valeera,I've got an idea... Let me sign up for you.,
360,,,"One the day of the Jousting Tournament, most of the girls arrived teamed up with close friends, or some with strangers.",
361,,,"Phoenix was teamed up with Amelia, Quinie, with Sonya, and of course, Michael with Lucifer. The most attractive team among them all, of course, was Valeera's team.",
362,,Student A,There are so many participants here...,
363,,Student B,It's because the tournament doesn't have complicated rules or require training.,
364,,Student B,You can even see Valeera participating with a ... a weird-looking person,
365,,Student A,You have to admit she looks real funny. A horsehead mask isn't necessary for this.,
366,,Student B,Her name is Bojack... Why do I feel as if I've heard that name before?,
367,,Student B,"But even without that strange person, Valeera's team still looks extremely strong. I wonder if they can win.",
368,,Student A,We will find out soon enough.,
369,,Ithil,Safety first. I will take the lead when the match starts.,
370,,Turin,"I can take more physical damage, so me being in front is the best option.",
371,,Kratos,I'm the strongest out of all of you. It will be easier for us if I take lead.,
372,,Ithil,"As I said, safety is the first priority, whether we win or lose. Valeera will not be safe if you lead the team.",
373,,Kratos,We should aim for the first place. This is a competition unless you forgot.,
374,,Turin,"According to my calculations, our win-rate will be at it's highest if you let me lead the team.",
375,,Turin,"And as far as stability goes, Valeera is safer in my hands.",
376,,Kratos,"No, it's too dangerous. What if you...",
377,,Valeera,Wait... I never volunteered to be the rider!,
378,,,Valeera's complaint was lost in the argument.,
379,,Valeera,I guess Ithil is the leader in the end...,
380,,Valeera,It just feels uncomfortable when others hold my legs.,
381,,Ithil,Focus! The match has started.,
382,,Kratos,You're overreacting. Winning this will be a piece of cake.,
383,,Valeera,"Wait, K--- Bojack, if you run too fast, Ithil might...",
384,,Ithil,"Don't worry, we can catch up with her! But you need to hold on tight, it's gonna be a bumpy ride.",
385,,Turin,The team on our 11 o'clock is distracted by others. There is our chance to get their headband!,
386,,Valeera,Yes!!! We did it!,
387,,Turin,"Nice! Next, lets go for - AAAHHH!!",
388,,,Turin had gotten hit.,
389,,,"Quinie and Sonya had tried to get Valeera's headband, but Turin took the hit for her.",
390,,Kratos,How... Dare you!!!,
391,,Ithil,"Bojack, calm down! It's just a game…",
392,,,But Kratos ignored the warning and knocked Sonya down to the ground.,
393,,Valeera,That's... overdoing it... Now we have attracted everyone's attention.,
394,,Kratos,"Let them come. If it wasn't because of Turin, they'd already be vaporized.",
395,,Ithil,Let's focus on the game. We've got a team incoming from 2 o'clock.,
396,,Kratos,Alright! Let's take them down once and for all.,
397,,Valeera,Wait... At least let our rider rest for a little bit...,
398,,Valeera,"… In the end, we won first place, but almost our entire score was won with Kratos's charges.",
399,,Turin,We even broke the school record! Gabriel must be so happy that there's something to be written about for the school newspaper.,
400,,Valeera,That's pretty embarrassing.,
401,,Kratos,It wasn't much of a challenge. I didn't even break a sweat.,
402,,Kratos,But I still have a bone to pick with the team who hit Turin...,
403,,Ithil,Enough! I believe you got what you want. Now beat it.,
404,,Kratos,I will... Be seeing you on the battlefield.,
405,,Valeera,Then please at least take this newspaper. It has a picture of all of us on it.,
406,,Turin,"Uh, Kratos's face is covered by the horse mask...",
407,,Ithil,"Don't worry, it makes the picture even better.",
408,,Kratos,"Hey, I'm still here!",
409,Orienteering,Valeera,"I believe you have read through the rules of this competition. But as the judge, I still need to remind you:",
410,,Valeera,"First, you need to reach the designated spots one by one.",
411,,Valeera,"Second, you are not allowed to accelerate your movement with wings, vehicles, or servants. You will be disqualified if you're found doing this.",
412,,Valeera,"Third, give it your all and have fun!",
413,,Jacob,"Sister, she said no wings...",
414,,Esau,Why??? Probably because...,
415,,Jacob,You reminded her about the advantages of wings during the soccer match...,
416,,Esau,Oh no! We can't win without our wings...,
417,,Esau,"Jacob, let's just quit now.",
418,,Jacob,So... You never considered playing fair...,
419,,Esau,"No, I'm kidding! How could I be such a despicable person... Hahaha...",
420,,,Esau was not the only student who wanted to sink to such methods.,
421,,Esau,Don't worry too much. See all those wings and vehicles? They all had the same idea.,
422,,Esau,Maybe Phoenix and Wraith thought they could get the upper hand.,
423,,Pandaria,Hmm... No servants? Looks like I'm going to be the last place.,
424,,Chevalir,You panda isn't fast at all...,
425,,Pandaria,Don't underestimate my Pandy! He's fast like a cat.,
426,,Pandaria,"Where's your pony, by the way? You didn't bring him with you?",
427,,Chevalir,He's still sleeping at the Animal Welfare Club. I'm riding a motorbike these days.,
428,,Chevalir,"But I didn't plan to use it in the competition, so I parked it elsewhere.",
429,,Pandaria,That's a pity... You could win if you brought it with you.,
430,,Chevalir,I told you. I don't cheat.,
431,,Pandaria,I'm just saying... I won't cheat either.,
432,,Valeera,Ready--- Set----,
433,,,"Valeera fired her starting pistol, and the competitors rushed towards the first destination.",
434,,Pandaria,(panting)... The first spot is... The School Gate.,
435,,Pandaria,It's... impossible... for me to make it... without Pandy...,
436,,Pandaria,Someone... Help me!,
437,,,"As if a divine force had heard her plea, a motorbike appeared before Pandaria parked in the garden.",
438,,Pandaria,This must be Chivalir's bike.,
439,,Pandaria,"With this, I could finish the competition in no time...",
440,,Pandaria,No one would know I cheated if I use a different route.,
441,,Pandaria,"Plus, a motorbike should be easy to ride, just like Pandy...",
442,,Pandaria,Chevalir… just consider this a rental~,
443,,Pandaria,"Uh, if it's just like mounting Pandy...",
444,,Pandaria,I should sit on its back and give it orders.,
445,,Pandaria,"Okay! Now motorbike, get me to the lake of House Human!",
446,,Pandaria,"Huh? Motorbike, I'm your master's close friend. Let's go!",
447,,Pandaria,It's not responding... I remember Chevalir placed her hands on these two sticks when she rides this bike.,
448,,Pandaria,So... These must be the ears of the motorbike!,
449,,Pandaria,That's right! Even Pandy can run faster if I keep pulling his ears~,
450,,Pandaria,Sorry for being so rude. Let's go!,
451,,,Pandaria happened upon the method for starting the motorbike and rushed out. But the lawn doesn't look as happy as she does.,
452,,Pandaria,Wow~ It's so fast~ I knew Chevalir chose you for a reason!,
453,,Pandaria,"Bud Elf, I will return and apologize for the lawn later-------",
454,,Pandaria,Huh? Motorbike? Stop! We're running into the lake!!!,
455,,Pandaria,Look out!!! Help! (blublublub)...,
456,,,"Pandaria lets go of the throttle and cries out for help, but it was too late...",
457,,Chevalir,"Pandaria, can you tell me why you are in the lake with my bike?",
458,,Pandaria,Umm... Maybe later…?,
459,,Pandaria,(blublublublub)...,
460,,Pandaria,Help me! I can't swim!,
461,,Valeera,"I understand what happened. Pandaria, your score won't count and you will need to buy Chevalir a new motorbike. Any questions?",
462,,Pandaria,...No.,
463,,Valeera,I will take this record card.,
464,,Pandaria,"Valeera, can I please keep the card?",
465,,Valeera,"Nope, it's against our policy.",
466,,Chevalir,Are you trying to keep it so you can cheat again in the next competition?,
467,,Chevalir,That's impossible. The route is different each time.,
468,,Pandaria,Uh... No... I just want to practice riding the motorbike~,
469,,Pandaria,Please lend me your motorbike next time~,
470,,Chevalir,No way!!!,
