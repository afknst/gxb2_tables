1000001,,???,I am your Senpai——|I am your Senpai——*,
3,,*,You will start a brand new journey with all girls in this fantastic academy!!,
4,,*,"....All  the new girls are super adorable just like before. As the unique and supreme Senpai on campus, I'm pleased to say this.",
5,,,Then it all went black. Don't know who hit me....,
6,,*,Ouch! That hurts.....,
7,,Michael,"Senpai, please behave.",
8,,Michael,"Hello, everyone! I'm Michael, the senior representative. Welcome to Yume Academy.",
9,,Michael,"As one of the seniors in the academy, I'm here to help you adapt your new life on campus. That includes teaching you knowledge and skills in combat.",
10,,*,"That hurts, Michael... After the ceremony, please head to the playground and prepare for the preliminary test. It will help decide your future.",
11,,*,"Well everyone! I look forward to staying with you. Enjoy this campus life, and become my new waifus.",
12,,,Then it all went dark. Somebody hit me again.,
13,,*,"Oh, what happened?.... Where am I?.....I? Am I.....?",
14,,Michael,Please ignore this idiot....,
15,,,A large number of students started to leave and making vague comments.,
16,,Aquaris,What? Test in the first day of academy?!,
17,,Aquaris,"Even if I am not prepared for this, I won't give up! Let's do this!",
18,,Aquaris,....I'm lost.,
19,,Aquaris,"Hello, do you know which way is to the playground? (Tapping on a girl's back)",
20,,Iron Fist,Ah!!!! Don't touch me from behind!! (Swinging her prosthetic arms),
21,,Aquaris,What are you doing?!,
22,,Aquaris,Someone is over there! Danger!,
23,,*,What——ah!!,
24,1-2a,,Just now——,
25,,*,Don't know how the test is going.... Let's check it out....(Walking towards the corner of teaching building),
26,,Aquaris,Someone over there! Danger——,
27,,*,What——ah!!,
28,,Iron Fist,Ah!!!! (Couldn't stop and falls),
29,,*,Ouch... What is this soft and paddy...(Saw my hands grasping the girl's chest),
30,,*,I'm...I'm sorry!,
31,,Iron Fist,"(Got up) Ah, sorry!! My mistake.... Are you hurt, Senpai?",
32,,*,I'm okay...(Noticed Iron Fist's prosthetic arm) This prosthetic arm.....You're Iron Fist. How is your body?,
33,,Iron Fist,"Yeah... All thanks to KongMing, I'm fully recovered.....",
34,,*,Are you heading to the test? Let's go there together?,
35,,Aquaris,Please take me with you. I'm lost!,
36,,*,W-What an energetic newbie... Come with me!,
37,,*,"Look, there is the playground , but we have to...",
38,,Aquaris,Why don't we just take a short cut? (Step on the lawn),
39,,*,Hey! Come back here! You can't step on that lawn!,
40,,Bud Elf,Ahhh!!! How dare you trample on my children who I worked so hard on! You must want to feel how hard I can punch!,
41,1-2b,Aquaris,Who is she?,
42,,*,She is Bud Elf. The nightmare of the Gardening Club. 1 of the 7 mysteries on campus. And you just stepped on her plants...,
43,1-2c,*,You're so screwed.,
44,,Aquaris,"Huh... What's wrong with her? She is so strong, it's scary...",
45,,*,Let's go before Bud Elf wakes up. Move... Move... Hey!!!,
46,,*,"If you don't want to die, then don't step on the lawn again. This way~",
47,,Aquaris,"Oh, yes.... (Haha, this is funny)",
48,1-3a,Iron Fist,"Senpai, the preliminary test... What's that?",
49,,Iron Fist,"KongMing left a note in the morning and told me to join the test, but she didn't tell me what the test is about...",
50,,*,The preliminary test will place you into different Houses after examining your skills and aptitude.,
51,,*,The Houses will decide where you belong in the Academy.,
52,,*,"Once you get admitted by the Academy and selected by a House, you will officially get accepted.",
53,,Iron Fist,Oh....,
54,,Aquaris,So... Is it like a Costume Ball? Or a dress-up before a show?,
55,,*,"Hahaha, you can see it that way.",
56,,*,"After all, it's Yume Academy... It's like a dream where nothing is impossible.",
57,,Aquaris,But Senpai... Could six Houses completely contain all the factions?,
58,,Aquaris,Maybe.... Maybe I'm actually a Minotaur?,
59,,*,"Well, we currently don't have a Minotaur on campus. But if Aquaris you're one of them...",
60,,*,Maybe you'll find yourself with a pair of horn and hooves when you wake up tomorrow.,
61,,Iron Fist,Haha...,
62,,Aquaris,"Hahahaha, I won't grow any hooves.",
63,,*,"Ah, now here is the scene of the test.",
64,,*,"Prepare yourselves, the seniors who run the tests won't go easy on you.",
65,,Aquaris,Is this place... House Human?... Hmm? Seems like someone is falling from the sky.,
66,,,Somebody fell from the sky and smash the ground.,
67,,Iron Fist,Wow!,
68,,Quinie,I... I'm dying... She must be a monster... (Faints and falls down),
69,,Saint,No fathead is going to enter our House!,
70,,Aquaris,The... The senior... Her fighting spirit is terrifying...,
71,,*,"Now this, is the person in charge of the test of House Human...",
72,,*,"Nice! Saint, you look sharp in the new academy year!",
73,,Saint,"(Noticed Aquaris) Well, are you the next one?",
74,,Aquaris,Hey! W-wait a minute.,
75,,Saint,"In a real fight, nobody will give you time to prepare! We start now!",
76,1-3c,Saint,"What? Just standing there taking my attack like that. Are you dumb? If I didn't stop, you'll spend half a month in the Healthcare Room.",
77,,Saint,"But... At least you've got something in you, you're Aquaris right? Congratulations, you've passed the House Human test.",
78,,Saint,"Our House uphold honor and martial art. If you choose us, we'll welcome you, Aquaris.",
79,,Aquaris,... I was completely dominated... I'm so weak. Looks like I'll need some special training later...,
80,,Iron Fist,... It's... horrible...,
81,,*,"(Iron Fist... In her first day at Yume Academy, she lost an arm and her body was extremely weak...)",
82,,*,"(Even now, she's recovered. Plus, she has an artificial arm for combat. But her shyness is keeping her from unleashing her full potential...)",
83,,*,"(As her Senpai, I need to give her a little push.)",
84,1-4a,*,"Here is the House Monster testing site. Iron Fist, I strongly suggest you to take the test here.",
85,,Nobunaga,Ha! Defeated another one! Why do these creeps try so hard to enter House Monster? It's fool's errand.,
86,,Nobunaga,Next!,
87,,Iron Fist,Even for me to fight such a strong opponent? I... I'm so scared...,
88,,Aquaris,Don't worry! I've found out that you're very strong from before!,
89,,Iron Fist,But...,
90,,*,"It's only the phantom of your past restraining you. Once you get to Yume Academy, you'll start a new life. You don't need to get entangled with your past.",
91,,*,"Besides, KongMing should also want you to be like that.",
92,,Iron Fist,KongMing senpai...,
93,,Iron Fist,Got it! I will try my best...,
94,,Aquaris,Fight! You can do this!,
95,,Nobunaga,"That's the spirit! All the students in House Monster, will walk their own path!",
96,,Nobunaga,"Now, show me what you got!",
97,1-4c,Nobunaga,You are very interesting... See you all next time.,
98,,Aquaris,"Sugoi! As expected, you're very strong! Congratulations!",
99,,Iron Fist,"I... I'm still scared... but, I don't know why or how. Whenever I think of KongMing senpai, I could loosen up a little bit..",
100,,*,"(House Monster, it seeks freedom and independence.)",
101,,*,"(Iron Fist, I hope... you can be truly independent in this Academy... I believe, you can do that.)",
102,1-5a,Aquaris,"Is this place the testing site for the House Angel? Ah, the senior over there. Was she the one who gave us a speech at the welcome ceremony...?",
103,,*,"That's Michael, the senior in charge of the preliminary test of House Angel.",
104,,Michael,"The creed of the house, are light, holiness, justice, and kindness.",
105,,Michael,"Behold these white wings. These are the bright symbol of the Light. And beneath thou shalt witness, we will fight for the weak and spread righteousness!",
106,,Michael,"Come on, lets follow the light of the lord!",
107,,Aquaris,What a shiny senior...,
108,,Iron Fist,"(She's so shiny, just like KongMing senpai... Will there be a chance... For girls like me to be as shiny as they are...?)",
109,,*,"Of course, Michael and her friend Lucifer, are the stars of Yume Academy!",
110,1-6a,KongMing,"You're late. I believe you've already seen Human, Monster, and Angel. Now it's my turn.",
111,,*,You have marvellous prediction...,
112,,Iron Fist,"Ahh, it's KongMing senpai...",
113,,Aquaris,Iron Fist... You look completely different once you've seen KongMing...,
114,,Bud Elf,Wait! Wait in line behind! Take this!,
115,,Aquaris,"Ah, it's the flower girl... Better hide myself and don't let her spot me...",
116,1-6c,Bud Elf,Eh... She's so strong...,
117,,*,"Not only is she shrewd, she's also an experienced fighter...",
118,,KongMing,House Fairy is for the smart student. And it won't fit idiots.,
119,,Aquaris,Huh? Why you're staring at me?,
120,,KongMing,"By the way Iron Fist, I think you'll have a great time in House Monster.",
121,,Iron Fist,Well... You are right.,
122,,*,Don't make a decision so soon. There are still two other houses. Let's go!,
123,1-7a,*,Here is the testing site of House Demon. The students here all share some common points with demons...,
124,,Iron Fist,The atmosphere is horrible...,
125,,*,"The senior who in charge of the test of House Demon, is actually a fallen angel.",
126,,Aquaris,Huh? Not a real demon? What is a fallen angel by the way?,
127,,Lucifer,It's even scarier than a demon!!,
128,,Iron Fist,Ahhhh it's horrible!!,
129,,Lucifer,Hahaha... What a lovely junior.,
130,,Lucifer,"Are you here for House Demon test? Then come here, and get ready...",
131,,Lucifer,...To face the power from the abyss!,
132,,,Black feathered wings sweeping across the sky.,
133,1-7c,Lucifer,Come on. Get up! Continue your useless struggle!,
134,,Lucifer,Your souls... Will be the greatest decoration for my throne...,
135,,*,Lucifer! Enough...,
136,,Lucifer,Oh!?,
137,,Lucifer,"Well, I forgot myself again... Hahaha...",
138,,Lucifer,Sorry about that. Hope I didn't frighten you too much.,
139,,Lucifer,The test is over. See you!,
140,,Iron Fist,"... Senpai, we better leave as soon as possible... If one day she appears behind me... I'll die of shock...",
141,1-8a,Aquaris,Huh? Didn't we just passed by this place?... House Ghost really deserves its reputation.,
142,,*,"That's what they good at. They are a group of ghosts, hiding in the darkness, spying on the world...",
143,,*,"That senior who was in charge of the test at House Ghost, was actually a vampire, watch out back there...",
144,,*,Perhaps... She will suddenly appear right behind you!!,
145,,Iron Fist,Ahhh it's horrible!,
146,,Aquaris,"Senpai, the vampire you said... Is it the young girl drinking black tea over there?",
147,,*,"Uh... Dracula, is it good for you to stay out in the sun over there?",
148,,*,You're ruining the reputation of your House and your race...,
149,,Dracula,"Lowlifes with no sense of propriety... tch, Why should I be in charge of all this?",
150,,Dracula,"Why should I be afraid of sunlight, or why should I take care of the new students. I'm the queen of vampires after all... Alright. Come on, you lowlifes.",
151,1-8c,Dracula,"Well, that's all. I will keep enjoying my tea. Begone! Lowlifes.",
152,,*,That's not black tea but blood that tastes like black tea...,
153,,*,"(Dracula, the mysterious vampire queen agreed to join the campus after the Academy promised to provide her artificial blood...)",
154,,*,(What an arrogant young vampire.),
155,,Dracula,"How dare you... If you keep talking like this, I'll drink your blood! I can suck you dry in two seconds!",
156,,Iron Fist,"... Senpai, we better leave now... If she appears behind me again... I'll be shocked to death...",
157,,*,Now you've seen all the houses... Have you made your decision?,
158,,Aquaris,I'm entering House Fairy! I will prove KongMing is wrong about me!,
159,,Iron Fist,"Emmm, I think I'll enter House Monster. KongMing senpai recommends it...",
160,,*,"Seems you've all decided... Then let's go to the banquet hall after you sign in, the seniors will prepare you a big meal!",
161,,Iron Fist,"Senpai, thank  you... For all the help today...",
162,,*,"It's my pleasure... As a senior, it's my responsibility to help the juniors.",
163,,*,(Even though... Sometimes I find myself being too earnest... Is that just my responsibility or is it something else...?),
164,1-9a,*,Wow... I'm like starving now!,
165,,*,Emm? What's that chaos about? Is there something rushing at us?,
166,,Quinie,All--- The--- Delicious--- Food--- Are--- Mine---,
167,,Quinie,There must be something you won't eat!!!,
168,,Iron Fist,"No, not really...",
169,,Quinie,Then that's mine! I'm also taking this one and that one!,
170,,*,Is that the newbie Saint beat into the Healthcare Room...?,
171,1-9c,Quinie,I... I can still eat... I'm still not full yet...,
172,,*,Finally it's meal time... Hmm? Another riot? No way!?,
173,1-10a,Elvis,Ahhh!!!,
174,,*,The students don't look good...,
175,,Quinie,"See, they are even naughtier than me!",
176,,*,"No, something is wrong! Save them!",
177,,Handana,Help!!!,
178,,,Juniors flee as Toy Girl floats in mid-air and casts spells around her.,
179,,Toy Girl,"Ah, more toys here~",
180,,Elvis,Ahhhh! Don't come here!,
181,,*,(CHAOS FIGURE detected----),
182,,*,"What, who? who's talking?",
183,,*,(Start the purification----),
184,,*,How.... My body.... My body is moving by itself...,
185,,Toy Girl,You look very different from other toys? Doesn't matter... Come here! Play with me!,
186,,Aquaris,"Senpai, what happened? Senpai!",
187,1-10c,*,(Chaos Figure... Failed to terminate... Threat eliminated. Mission complete),
188,,*,What... what was that?,
189,,*,What have I done?,
190,2-1a,*,"(37... 38... 39, and here we are.)",
191,,*,"Iron Fist, if you don't come out now you'll be late.",
192,,,I knocked on the door and found that it was unlocked. So I opened it and went in.,
193,,Cayla,Huh?,
194,,*,！？,
195,,Cayla,Ahhh---,
196,,,I found out I that it's the wrong room. I quickly close the door and run away.,
197,,*,(What? What's wrong? Did I made a mistake?),
198,,*,(Room 1239. It is Room 1239. Was the tip wrong? It couldn't be...),
199,,Nobunaga,Well well...,
200,,Nobunaga,"What a pervert, just got into the girl's dorm without fear or hesitation...",
201,,Nobunaga,It's been a long time since I last seeing this.,
202,,*,I'm not a pervert...,
203,,Nobunaga,"... Just admit it, haha.",
204,,Nobunaga,"No one can save you, pervert.",
205,,*,"This is a misunderstanding, I can explain...",
206,,Nobunaga,"If you're going to bully any of the girls, you'll have to go through me!!",
207,,Nobunaga,"Explain later, now I'll teach you a lesson!",
208,2-1b,Iron Fist,It's really... Senpai?,
209,,Iron Fist,I... I'll do my best... (she looks so scary),
210,,*,"Well, then... Iron Fist?",
211,,*,Where have you been...,
212,,Nobunaga,The pervert is somewhere out there. Get yourself ready to fight!,
213,2-1c,Iron Fist,Never thought Senpai would be a pervert...,
214,,*,I! AM! NOT!,
215,,*,KongMing left me a tip and asked me to pick you up,
216,,Iron Fist,"It's... KongMing senpai left me a tip, tell me that you need help here",
217,,Iron Fist,"So, even if I'm scared, I'll still help you...",
218,,*,…………………………,
219,,Nobunaga,Hahahaha!! Now this is hell of an explanation...,
220,,Nobunaga,"But look at the time, Iron Fist aren't you going to your first class?",
221,,Iron Fist,"Yes... Nobunaga senpai, how did you know that?",
222,,*,Because you are running late. Let's go !,
223,,Iron Fist,Okay...,
224,2-2a,Iron Fist,"Senpai, I'm sorry.",
225,,Iron Fist,Please don't hold anything against KongMing senpai...,
226,,*,How many times have you apologized?,
227,,Iron Fist,It's...,
228,,*,"It's your 42nd apology,",
229,,*,I don't hate her. Maybe KongMing just made a mistake.,
230,,Iron Fist,"But KongMing senpai also left me a note, she must have meant something.",
231,,*,"Iron Fist, you're really a bad talker...",
232,,Iron Fist,"Senpai, what are you talking about?",
233,,*,I'm talking about how we'll be late if we keep talking like this.,
234,,,"Walking on the road on campus, a crowds of students is in front of us. A few Discipline members line up and block the intersection.",

783,,Edward,Huh?,
784,,*,...Though the official fireworks display is canceled...,
785,,*,....the authority still agrees that students could organize other activities...,
786,,Iron Fist,Senpai! Let's hold a fireworks display by ourselves!,

2329,,*,(We cannot stay here forever. But a second assault will begin anywhere any place),
2330,,Aquaris,"I heard senpai called you Turin, right? You're so cute~",
2331,,Iron Fist,That's right!,
2332,,*,"So, I'm the only one worrying about this--?",
2333,,,"At the same time, the examiners of the Academy has got up on the stage.",
2334,,Michael,It's good to see you all!,
2335,,Michael,"As usual, House Angel will still fight for the light and protect the weak!",
2336,,Lucifer,"If you want to feel the abyss up close, come to House Demon!",
2337,,Lucifer,"Don't worry, I won't kill you.",
2338,,KongMing,"The disaster is over, and it's time for you to show your wisdom in House Fairy.",
2339,,Dracula,House Ghost has the rules which isn't changed.,
2340,,Dracula,"Why do I have to do this, it's dull to speak to the mortals~",
2341,,Nobunaga,"If you don't want to give the speech, just stay in your castle~",
2342,,Nobunaga,"Students of House Monster, please continue doing whatever you were doing before!",
2343,,Saint,"So far, House human has done well, keep up the good work!",
2344,,Saint,And we should give thanks---,
2345,,Saint,To the senior who built the foundation beneath all we've achieved.,
2346,,Saint,"After everything is settled, she went on her own course, but now she has returned.",
2347,,Saint,She's the first president of House Human--- Ithil!,
2348,,Aquaris,I thought the president of House Human is Saint.,
2349,,*,"She said it's the first president, not the current one~",
2350,,*,I'd want to know more about Ithil…,
2351,,Iron Fist,"But if most of us don't know her, why she's so welcomed?",
2352,,*,"The title of ""1st president"" surely works a lot~",
2353,,Ithil,"Girls, my name is Ithil, nice to meet you.",
2354,,*,"Oh no, she's more popular than predicted!",
2355,,Aquaris,"Hey, back off a little bit---",
2356,,*,They surely should pay us for the security after it's all over!!!,
2357,,*,"By the way, where's Turin?",
2358,,Iron Fist,She left when Ithil gets on the stage!,
2359,,Aquaris,Maybe it's just too noisy for her.,
2360,,*,? Is Ithil waving at me?,
2361,11-8,*,"So, as you have already---",
2362,,Ithil,"It's been a long time since I left the academy, I have no idea what happened during my absence,",
2363,,Ithil,So the Student Union appointed you as my guide.,
2364,,*,Are you a prophet?,
2365,,Ithil,I thought you have read my profile.,
2366,,*,"I sure did, but you know, that's just record~ I'd hope you can prove it.",
2367,,Ithil,"Sorry to let you down, I know all that without using my power.",
2368,,Ithil,I asked to let you become my guide.,
2369,,Ithil,Saint won't refuse me. She also told me something about Philosopher's Stone...,
2370,,*,She told you that too?,
2371,,Ithil,"So my power didn't fail me, you have the Philosopher's Stone...",
2372,,*,Nice try.,
2373,,Ithil,Surely it is.,
2374,,*,(Whisper) Why the sentence sounds so familiar?,
2375,,Ithil,Now let's talk about the stone.,
2376,,*,What stone? What are you talking about?,
2377,,Ithil,"Too late to pretend innocent now… Whatever, there's a Plan B~",
2378,,*,Hey! Wait! Calm down!,
2379,,Ithil,"Relax, we've got plenty of time to FIGURE, IT, OUT.",
2380,,*,How can I relax in this condition!!!,
2381,,*,!?,
2382,,*,Where is…,
2383,,Ithil,"This is the intersection point of time and space, no one will find us here.",
2384,,*,You surely meant to say there's no escape…,
2385,,*,What do you want?,
2386,,Ithil,Everything about Philosopher's Stone.,
2387,,Ithil,When did you find it? How did you get it?,
2388,,Ithil,How much do you know about the stone? How does it work?,
2389,,*,I beg your pardon?,
2390,,Ithil,You can answer the answers one by one.,
2391,,*,I don't know what's that for!,
2392,,Ithil,Yet you still brought it here.,
2393,,*,"I know it sounds strange... But do you know ""Li""? He told me the location.",
2394,,Ithil,Why he tells you the location?,
2395,,*,Maybe because I was the Supervisor?,
2396,,Ithil,Supervisor…,
2397,,*,"You know, maintain the campus running functionally and observe the threat of the world.",
2398,,*,"Seems ""Li"" did all these by controlling me.",
2399,,Ithil,I believe you're telling the truth but…,
2400,,Ithil,"You don't look reasonable like ""Li"" at all.",
2401,,*,That's why I got fired~,
2402,,*,"After defeating Seal, ""Li"" guided me to find the stone.",
2403,,*,"I don't know how it works, but maybe it's just my pension?",
2404,,Ithil,…I believe you.,
2405,,*,Can I go now?,
2406,,Ithil,…But.,
2407,11-9,Ithil,…But.,
2408,,*,Hmm?,
2409,,Ithil,"Memory works mysteriously,",
2410,,Ithil,"Sometimes, when you see something, the brain will send a message:",
2411,,Ithil,"""I have saw this somewhere else""",
2412,,Ithil,Maybe even ourselves are not aware of this period of memory…,
2413,,*,Ithil--,
2414,,Ithil,"Sorry, but I want to give it a try…",
2415,,,"Power of Chaos starts to form around Ithil, she seems have summoned something horrible.",
2416,,Terror Figure,Tremble before me!!!,
2417,,*,Hey! This is overdoing!,
2418,,Ithil,Does this look familiar?,
2419,,*,I don't even know what it is!!!,
2420,,*,(Gasp)…,
2421,,Ithil,Does this Terror Figure reminds you anything?,
2422,,*,NOPE! I've told you everything I knew! Am I supposed to make up a story?,
2423,,Ithil,My prediction can't be wrong…,
2424,,Ithil,Philosopher's Stone must be related with Terror Figure…,
2425,,*,"The Terror Figure you summoned, is that made of Chaos power?",
2426,,*,How did you do that?,
2427,,Ithil,You will never become adult if you ask so many questions~,
2428,,*,I'm an adult already…,
2429,,Ithil,"Forget that, we're done today, just return to your dorm---",
2430,,*,Finally...,
2431,,*,Ithil---,
2432,,*,Huh? When did she left??,
2433,11-10,*,"After that, Ithil released me,",
2434,,*,And I'm here to see the firework~,
2435,,Iron Fist,"I thought you could've been more awkward in that kind of situation, senpai.",
2436,,Aquaris,But why doesn't she join us?,
2437,,*,She didn't mention that.,
2438,,*,"(After getting out, she just disappeared)",
2439,,Lucifer,Maybe she's just too shy to join the club~,
2440,,Michael,"Alright, it's about time, let's light the firework~",
2441,,Michael,I've prepared this for a long time--,
2442,,*,It's beautiful...,
2443,,*,(And familiar...),
2444,,*,(Just like I've done this before...),
2445,,,"The girls are also enjoying the performance, and smile just couldn't come off their faces...",
2446,,*,(None shall their lives be ruined...),
2447,,*,(I will make certain of it!),
2448,12-1,Hottie,"Hehe, there are so many students attending the class today~",
2449,,Sonya,"They're just here for ability practice, Hottie, don't you ever think of it.",
2450,,Guan Yin,And we're here to ensure you won't scare them.,
2451,,Hottie,"Senpai, can you hear that?",
2452,,*,Hear what?,
2453,,Hottie,My heart beat!,
2454,,Hottie,I feel your love by the caring! Let me train you in repay~,
2455,,Hottie,Don't be afraid~ It's the training of love~,
2456,,*,Wait? I'm not prepared...,
2457,,Hottie,It's good to have an exercise like this~,
2458,,*,Not for me! That was too close...,
2459,,,Some one clapped her hands from our back...,
2460,,Ithil,It's an excellent practice!,
2461,,*,Ithil?,
2462,,Hottie,President!,
2463,12-1,*,President?,
2464,,Ithil,"Don't be too surprised, I just reclaimed my title.",
2465,,*,Then what about Saint...,
2466,,Ithil,She has a secret mission~,
2467,,*,(Again? But surely it's Saint's style...),
2468,,Ithil,"As your president, I'm impressed.",
2469,,Ithil,"So, let's begin a second round!",
2470,,*,Whyyyy?!,
2471,,Guan Yin,It's worth a try!,
2472,,Sonya,I'm getting excited~,
2473,,*,???,
2474,,Ithil,Let's begin now!,
2475,,Ithil,"Anyone who wants to join us, just step in!",
2476,,*,"W-wait, I'm not ready yet!",
2477,,Ithil,The enemies won't provide time for your to prepare!,
2478,,*,Is that really necessary? We're not against each other!,
2479,,Ithil,Consider it a drop quiz~,
2480,,Guan Yin,That's the one we shall call a walking legend.,
2481,,Sonya,Outstanding!,
2482,12-3,*,You didn't take that seriously....,
2483,,Ithil,Are you available now?,
2484,,*,What? I'm busy if you're here for the Terror Figure issue.,
2485,,Ithil,"Relax, I won't do that again.",
2486,,Aquaris,Again? What have you done last time?,
2487,,Iron Fist,Secret between senpai and Ithil?,
2488,,Aquaris,I heard Ithil was having a fight here.,
2489,,Iron Fist,...Me too~,
2490,,Girls,That's also what we heard!,
2491,,*,Crazy fans...,
2492,,Ithil,Thanks for your support.,
2493,,Ithil,"Now, please let me have some private talk with your senpai~",
2494,,Ithil,I want you to join me to Grand Library Ulbricht.,
2495,,*,Come again?,
2496,,Ithil,"The biggest library in campus, Grand Library Ulbricht.",
2497,,*,Never heard of it.,
2498,,Ithil,But it has been there since the Academy is first built.,
2499,,*,"Unbelievable, why no one knows that?",
2500,,Ithil,Because it's forbidden?,
2501,,Ithil,No matter what---,
2502,,Guardian,Beep! Intruder detected!,
2503,,Guardian,Unauthorized personnel is not allowed to enter when during the library is closed.,
2504,,Guardian,Please leave immediately!,
2505,,*,"Ithil, you must be an authorized personnel, right?",
2506,,Ithil,"(Nod) Yes, I am.",
2507,,*,Good to know that.,
2508,,Ithil,But you're not.,
2509,,*,What do you mean exactly?,
2510,,Guardian,"Intruder refused to leave the property, engaging!",
2511,,Guardian,Attack... Failed...,
2512,,*,(Gasp)…,
2513,,Ithil,You finally made it~,
2514,,*,"Ithil, are you just standing there?",
2515,,Ithil,I have faith in you.,
2516,,Ithil,"Now, let's move forward~",
2517,12-4,*,…,
2518,,*,…,
2519,,*,Is this really a library?,
2520,,*,It's more like a labyrinth!,
2521,,Guardian,Intruder detected!,
2522,,Guardian,Defense protocol activated!,
2523,,*,"Please, I don't want to fight any more! Can you show me the way out?",
2524,,Guardian,"Question confirmed, Default answer applied: Negative.",
2525,,Guardian,Wipe... Out...,
2526,,*,It's bigger than it appears to be...,
2527,,*,"Either way, I don't what to be detected by those guardians anymore...",
2528,,*,"So, this must be a labyrinth called library! How long have I been in here?",
2529,,*,It must have been more than a week! How can I get out?,
2530,,???,Actually it's more like one day~,
2531,12-5,*,Who said that?,
2532,,???,It's more polite to identify yourself first!,
2533,,*,I'm---,
2534,,???,"But before that, show me what you got~~",
2535,,???,Try defeat the Ultra Guardian!,
2536,,*,Is that enough? I thought you just need my name?,
2537,,???,"Haha, that was just an excuse~",
2538,,???,"But I have to admit, you did good~",
2539,,？？？,Ithil wasn't lying~,
2540,,*,…,
2541,,???,Why you don't say something?,
2542,,*,I just don't want to give you another excuse~,
2543,,Valeera,"Well, but Ithil didn't mention you're also very interesting~",
2544,,Valeera,"You can call me Valeera, and I'm the curator of Grand Library Ulbricht~",
2545,,Valeera,"Congratulations, you have passed my test~",
2546,,*,Valeera? Are you also a student?,
2547,,Valeera,Never thought you would skip the part of the test.,
2548,,Valeera,Don't just judge me from the appearance! I also experienced the first invasion!,
2549,,Valeera,"There's also rumors in campus, something like the Valkyrie in legend~",
2550,,Ithil,Valeera fought by me side in the 1st invasion.,
2551,,*,Ithil?! When do you get there!,
2552,,Ithil,Always.,
2553,,*,"Huh? Whatever, this must be another test. By the way, whats the first... invasion?",
2554,,Valeera,Don't you know that?,
2555,,Ithil,He must have forgotten that...,
2556,,Ithil,"As you know, after the war, many chose to forget about it.",
2557,,Valeera,"The war meant everything but happy, this is the best choice.",
2558,,Valeera,Only few of us chose to remember.,
2559,,Ithil,"After the first invasion is over, we followed the command of ""Li"" and built Yume Academy.",
2560,,Ithil,Then I transferred my leadership to Saint and left the campus to find an answer.,
2561,,*,An answer for what?,
2562,,Ithil,You will know that later.,
2563,,*,"...Okay. I'm still working on believing that, but---",
2564,,*,What do you really want to do?,
2565,12-6,Valeera,"After the first invasion, I took my time to find the truth about Philosopher's Stone.",
2566,,Valeera,I believe it is the stone Seal left to us before he perish.,
2567,,*,So?,
2568,,Valeera,"Everything happened before, was just going with someone's plan.",
2569,,Ithil,And the goal for the plan is to refine the stone.,
2570,,*,???,
2571,,*,You've got to be kidding me?,
2572,,Ithil,We're very serious about this...,
2573,,Valeera,Let me introduce you the Terror Figure.,
2574,,*,I've fought this thing before!!,
2575,,*,(Gasp)... But stronger than the one Ithil showed me...,
2576,,Valeera,The one you mentioned was just a counterfeit.,
2577,,Ithil,That was just a test.,
2578,,*,And is this one a real Terror--- whatever it is?,
2579,,Valeera,Of course---,
2580,,Valeera,Not~ The real Terror Figure is much stronger!,
2581,,*,"Then, why is Terror Figure related to the Philosopher's Stone?",
2582,,Valeera,"I think, it can be used to summon more Terror Figures.",
2583,,Valeera,"So, I think it's necessary to let me and Ithil to rebuild a defense system to protect Philosopher's Stone--",
2584,12-7,*,So be it.,
2585,,Valeera,"I'm glad have you on our side, but don't believe anyone this easily again!",
2586,,*,"I can sense your genuineness, you won't lie to me on this!",
2587,,Valeera,"Thanks, you can say that again.",
2588,,*,"Plus, if you're really my enemy, you just need to get what you want with force.",
2589,,Ithil,You talked too much.,
2590,,*,Trust is the basic for cooperation.,
2591,,*,And I believe you. You're the living legends!,
2592,,*,(Though something happened and made the legend unknown by many...),
2593,,,A week later...,
2594,,Valeera,Ta-Da! Complete!,
2595,,*,Impressive!,
2596,,Valeera,Please give the compliment in details.,
2597,,*,"Accompanied by the marvelous magic of Valeera, Ithil's design of the defense line flawless,",
2598,,*,"Now it covers every corner of this area, no one can get close to it without notice.",
2599,,Valeera,"Actually, we still have one thing left to do!",
2600,,*,What do you mean?,
2601,,Valeera,We will need to prove this will work!,
2602,,Valeera,I'll leave the job on you~ Assemble some girls you trust and attack here!,
2603,,Ithil,"Knowledge is a treasure, but practice is key to it.",
2604,,*,...Okay.,
2605,,*,"So, here I am.",
2606,,Iron Fist,"I got it, senpai. Leave that to me.",
2607,,Aquaris,We'll do our best!,
2608,,*,"Just watch your back out there, as I know, the first line of defense is--",
2609,,*,Terror Figure!!,
2610,12-8,Ithil,"Congratulations, you have passed the first defense line.",
2611,,Aquaris,Ithil!,
2612,,Iron Fist,It's our honor to aid you.,
2613,,Ithil,"(Smile) Thank you, let's proceed.",
2614,,Ithil,"Here is the second line of defense, me!",
2615,,*,Wut?,
2616,,Ithil,This time is for real!,
2617,,Ithil,Taste the power of space!,
2618,,Aquaris,That's how your ability works?,
2619,,Iron Fist,Amazing!,
2620,,*,Don't you feel pain when you got hit?,
2621,,Ithil,"Alright, go test the third line of defense~",
2622,,Ithil,Valeera has been waiting for a long time~,
2623,12-9,Valeera,Hello~ Welcome~,
2624,,Aquaris,So cute! Is she really our senior?,
2625,,*,Aquaris! Don't say that to a senior!,
2626,,Valeera,"Don't worry, I like what she's saying",
2627,,Aquaris,But is she qualified?,
2628,,Valeera,…,
2629,,Valeera,It's time to let you know the power of the curator of Grand Library Ulbricht---,
2630,,Valeera,"Elementalist, Valeera!!!",
2631,,Aquaris,She's too strong...,
2632,,Iron Fist,We're outmatched!,
2633,,Iron Fist,She's surely the master of elements.,
2634,,Iron Fist,"She could control the elements, even the matters so easily... just like...",
2635,,*,It has become her instinct.,
2636,12-10,*,We still have a lot work to do to reach what the seniors had achieved...,
2637,,Valeera,The weak won't survive from that war. But I see potential in you~,
2638,,*,I have a question. Why Philosopher's Stone is wanted by someone?,
2639,,*,"I don't know how it appears, but we had a tough battle before that...",
2640,,Ithil,…,
2641,,Valeera,Fine! Let me tell you the story.,
2642,,Valeera,"During the first invasion, after I defeated the Chaos Legion with Ithil at the Valley of the beginning, we met ""her""",
2643,,*,Who?,
2644,,"""Enigma""",Do you know about this valley?,
2645,,Ithil,Nope.,
2646,,"""Enigma""",Here used to be known as The Monument of Boundaries.,
2647,,Ithil,The Monument of Boundaries?,
2648,,"""Enigma""",This is the place where the first generation of life were bred.,
2649,,"""Enigma""",Some believe there's the code of life hidden here.,
2650,,Ithil,"So, this is the Land of the Beginning?",
2651,,Valeera,Are you sure about this?,
2652,,Valeera,"Ithil, let's go and check it out.",
2653,,*,What did Ithil see?,
2654,,Ithil,Just some meaningless codes.,
2655,,Valeera,"""She"" led Ithil to the codes on purpose!",
2656,,Valeera,"I spent a lot of time on cracking the code,",
2657,,Valeera,And the result was surprising---,
2658,,Ithil,It's the information about Singularity...,
2659,,*,Singularity?,
2660,,Valeera,It's the key information for the teleportation.,
2661,,Valeera,"With that, the main force of Chaos Legion would be able to maneuver secretly to the back of United Force.",
2662,,Ithil,"According to that theory, the traitor who caused the annihilation of the United force...",
2663,,Ithil,"""Enigma"".",
2664,,*,Who is she?,
2665,,Valeera,She died in that war.,
2666,,Ithil,But there was no proof to that.,
2667,,Valeera,But her sword...,
2668,,Ithil,"That's just a weapon belongs to ""Enigma"", no one found her body.",
2669,,Valeera,"The entire camp was destroyed, there was no survivor...",
2670,,Ithil,I told you! Her BODY is not found!!!,
2671,,Ithil,"And we all know, everything is not over yet.",
2672,,Valeera,"Ithil, calm down!",
2673,,Ithil,"Sorry, I was...",
2674,,Ithil,"For all these years, I just want to know the answer to my questions...",
2675,,Ithil,"Is ""Enigma"" the traitor?",
2676,,Ithil,Why she reminds me about the information of Singularity?,
2677,,Ithil,Why she betrayed us?,
2678,13|-1,Ithil,"Sorry, I shouldn't be so angry.",
2679,,*,"It's okay, Ithil.",
2680,,Iron Fist,"Although we don't know what happened exactly, but we can understand how you feel.",
2681,,Valeera,"Don't be so sorry, seniors shall have some privileges~",
2682,,*,"Excuse me, but the ""Enigma"" you mentioned, who...",
2683,,Valeera,Uh... That's not a secret. But it's actually a code name--,
2684,,Aquaris,Senpai! Someone's coming...,
2685,,*,Intruders? Just as we predicted...,
2686,,Ithil,"There's no time to waste, let's get to the first defense line!",
2687,,Iron Fist,"Senpai, the hostiles are wearing bee masks!",
2688,,*,Do you have any idea?,
2689,,Ithil,…,
2690,,Valeera,"I actually have a suspect, but...",
2691,,*,Bees...,
2692,,Ithil,"We'll talk about this later, now it's time for battle!",
2693,13-2,Iron Fist,Uh... the way they fight...,
2694,,*,"Even it will cause injury, even teammates are standing in the way,",
2695,,*,They didn't stop the attack...,
2696,,*,Without any hesitation...,
2697,,*,Bees cannot be so mean!,
2698,,Valeera,You're really close to the answer!,
2699,,Ithil,"The second wave is coming, prepare for battle.",
2700,,*,Aren't you joining us?,
2701,,Valeera,We need to save our power for the big ones~,
2702,,Valeera,"These are just skirmishers, I have faith in you!",
2703,,Aquaris,"Senpai, consider it a test from the seniors!",
2704,,Iron Fist,We cannot let them down!,
2705,,*,"Hostiles in sight, prepare for battle!",
2706,13-3,Aquaris,"Senpai, they're overwhelming us!",
2707,,*,There's too many!,
2708,,Ithil,You need to hold the line a little bit longer.,
2709,,*,What?,
2710,,Valeera,That's not all of them~,
2711,,*,But it's already too many for us!!,
2712,,*,"If you don't move right now, we will need a tomb instead of a first aid kit!",
2713,,Valeera,"Oh, ye of little faith~",

2773,,*,A dummy!?!?,
2774,,Valeera,Surprise~,
2775,,*,"Well, that's just...",
2776,,Valeera,I also placed a tracker on that dummy.,

2787,,*,I wonder why you get your eyes covered?,
2788,,*,Was the reason just like the rumor said?,

2792,,Valeera,"Hahaha, did you hear that Ithil?",
2793,,Valeera,"That's an interesting theory, and funny!",
2794,,Ithil,"... My eyes, are known as the Eyes of True Sight.",

2822,,Linky,How come... this doesn't work?,
2823,,Ithil,…,
2824,,,Ithil threw a dagger and hit the stone.,
2825,,Linky,It's broken... Broken!?,
2826,,Linky,You shall all pay for this!!!,
2827,,Linky,Die! Die! Die!,
2828,,Linky,What have you done! You've ruined my only hope to resurrect my master!,
2829,,Valeera,That is just a dummy!,
2830,,Linky,...What did you say?,
2831,,Valeera,We just want to know why you want that Philosopher's Stone...,
2832,,Linky,How do you prove that?,
2833,,Valeera,"It's obvious, the real Philosopher's Stone won't break that easily!",
2834,,Linky,You'd better not be lying.,
2835,,*,"So, why do you want Philosopher's Stone so bad?",
2836,,Linky,"The reason is simple, to revive my master.",
2837,,Ithil,"""Enigma""...",
2838,,Linky,That's right.,
2839,,Valeera,Why do you think Philosopher's Stone could help you to do that?,
2840,,Linky,Someone told me that. But she never showed up.,
2841,,Valeera,Just a sound...,
2842,,Linky,She also said the traitor who caused the total annihilation of the United Force is now hiding in Academy!,
2843,,Linky,I'm also trying to protect the stone from the traitor!,
2844,,Valeera,No way...,
2845,,Linky,Just forget about that.,
2846,,Linky,The sound also mentioned Philosopher's Stone is hidden in Grand Library Ulbricht.,
2847,,Linky,She even failed to tell the correct location of the stone while you are having a drill here.,
2848,,Linky,I shouldn't have believed her anyway.,
2849,,Valeera,Ithil...,
2850,,Ithil,"Linky, since it was a misunderstanding, let's talk about that later. We need to head back to the library now!",
2851,,Linky,...Is there anything wrong?,
2852,,*,"The location we guard was a decoy, so....",
2853,,Linky,The real stone is still in the library!?,
2854,14-1,*,"Iron Fist, can you still catch up?",
2855,,Iron Fist,It's not very far away... we can do this...,
2856,,Aquaris,I can be faster if you want!,
2857,,*,"Save your power, there could be enemy anywhere...",
2858,,Iron Fist,You're just worrying something won't happen...,
2859,,Minion,"Enemy in sight, engaging!!",

2861,,*,"Excuse us, we don't have time to play with you.",
2862,,Minion,I recognize you! You ruined my plan last time!,
2863,,*,What? You're the one attacked Turin...,
2864,,Minion,"Turin!! Damn, I should've told Linky about this!",
2865,,*,Why did you attack Turin?,
2866,,Minion,You won't need to know this as you're going to die!,
2867,,Minion,I lost...,
2868,,*,Why does Linky's minion attacked Turin...,

2872,,*,(Gasp)... We're here...,
2873,,Iron Fist,It's good... to see no hostile here...,
2874,,Ithil,...Not that good.,
2875,,Valeera,It's too quiet out here.,
2876,,Ithil,"No matter what, we'll need to take a look first. Everyone stay back.",
2877,,,Ithil rose her hand and took off her eye mask.,
2878,,,"Then she opened the gate, and dodged a purple flash.",
2879,,*,"How could she see that in darkness... !!! Valeera, is her eye mask... took off...?",
2880,,Valeera,She's using her Eyes of True Sight now.,
2881,14-2,Ithil,It's a trap...,
2882,,*,"Ithil, what have you seen? What's behind the gate?",
2883,,Ithil,"It appears to be a Terror Figure, but I don't feel the same aura.",
2884,,Valeera,So it just looks alike right?,
2885,,Ithil,"But we still cannot lower our cautiousness, I will test that myself!",
2886,,???,Waaaaaagh!,
2887,,Valeera,Ithil...,
2888,,Ithil,"I'm okay, it's not a real Terror Figure.",
2889,,Valeera,Good to hear that...,
2890,,Ithil,The current situation is still acceptable...,
2891,,Ithil,"It looks similar, but is much weaker.",
2892,,*,Well... That's convenient...,
2893,14-3,Iron Fist,"Since they're not Terror Figures, let's clear them out first!",
2894,,Aquaris,"Well, though the library breeds many strange creatures, these are not on the list~",
2895,,*,"Even they're weaker, you still need to watch out!",
2896,,Iron Fist,"Don't worry, senpai!",
2897,,Iron Fist,This feels... strange...,

2899,,Ithil,They're learning from us...,
2900,,Valeera,"Though the movements still seems awkward, but it's our skills!",
2901,,Iron Fist,Yes... now I know how much they suffered when they took this strike from Ithil!,
2902,,Iron Fist,Valeera's skills aim to kill too!,
2903,,Valeera,I got it! They're the Mimics!,
2904,,*,Mimics?,
2905,,Valeera,Mimics are spawned from the energy of the Terror Figures.,
2906,,Valeera,"According to the research, they will fight with everything they meet after being spawned.",
2907,,Valeera,"Copy all the moves, optimize them, and finally...",
2908,,*,They will become Terror Figures?,
2909,,Valeera,Correct! But the process to achieve this is lost long ago...,
2910,,Valeera,It's even before the first invasion!,
2911,,*,This can't be good...,
2912,14-4,Ithil,"Alright, let's move on!",
2913,,*,Were we resting?,
2914,,Valeera,"In combat, consider talking a method to rest!",
2915,,Ithil,"Valeera, concentrate!",
2916,,Valeera,Roger that!,

2923,,Valeera,"This is Grand Library Ulbricht, it is my domain!!",
2924,,Valeera,"My game, my turf, my rules!",
2925,,Iron Fist,Are we here with the same senior?,
2926,,Aquaris,The energy reading is a lot higher than before!,
2927,,*,That's the reason she could survive the first invasion...,
2928,,Linky,Huh? Why are there so many Terror Figures out here?,
2929,,Linky,"No, they're not...",
2930,,*,"According to Valeera, they're Mimics",
2931,,Linky,Mimics? Those weaklings who didn't even dare to show up during the last invasion?,
2932,,Linky,"Ithil, Valeera, I'm going in.",
2933,,Linky,Don't get hurt---,
2934,,Linky,My weapon won't recognize what it's hitting!!,

2949,,Linky,Is that...,
2950,,,"The broken sword was picked up by a dark figure,",
