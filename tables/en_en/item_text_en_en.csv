94,The eye of Vulcan,Special Item,"
A piece of red crystal, one of the ""Antiques"". It\'s the relic of Hunter\'s tribe that grants the Hunters power of fire.

In the legend of Hunter\'s tribe, the crystal used to be the right eye of Azachil, the god of fire and hunt. The story is that Azachil left her right eye to protect her believers from winter and continues her eternal hunt.

There\'s no evidence for the god really exists, but when you look into the crystal, you will feel like a fierce creature inside of it is also staring at you."
95,Turin's Game,Special Item,"
Designed by Sivney and Turin, A.K.A Servant Controller. After the last modification, this device can induce or even control the behavior of Servants in a certain area. This device has some hidden features, but Sivney never told anyone how to activate them.

During the war against Chaos, Turin caused great damage to the Hunters Tribe with this device, and she failed to understand what she has taken from them or feel any guilt until she gains her self conscious. This is surely a tragedy, but the good news is, now she has earned a chance to redeem herself.

Tips: ""Servant"" is not a specific kind of creature, all the non-human creatures that can be tamed can be called as ""Servants""."

175,Eggret's Book,Special Item,"
The strange book from Valeera’s library now remains still, apart from its eye, it looks like an ordinary old book. Most of its pages have decayed and tattered only leaving a few stories intact. 

The founder of Summoning magic, Eggret, felt an unprecedented crisis in his late years due to the threat of chaos and thus began the research of the most complex subject of all— using magic to create a similar world in order to provide a better place for future generations to live in forever. 

This book was only an experimental product that was created with well-known stories as the cornerstone for its ""world"". It is said that Eggret died for this research without accomplishing it. And now, even these stories are buried in history and the world in the book thus becomes distorted. After all, when reality is lost, an imaginary world means nothing. "
