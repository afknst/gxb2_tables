7,,Dracula,"Eh, Halloween night? I heared that before,\nbut never pay attention to it.\nBoring festival means nothing to my eternal life.",
8,,Witch,"I'm Witch, little vampire~\nIt seems you have opinions about new fresh\nblood bag?",
9,,Dracula,"Are you covet my prey?\nDon't even think about it, and this has nothing\nto do with Halloween.",
10,,Witch,"You misunderstand, I just want to invite you to\nmy grocery store~",
11,,Dracula,Grocery store? Not interesting......,
12,,Witch,"Listen, little vampire, The meaning of festivals\nis to leave the common memories with others,\nshare happiness and sorrow together.",
13,,Witch,"Halloween is coming soon, if you help me to\npromote this festival in campus, I will bring you\na gift to help you to attract your blood bag~",
14,,Dracula,It seems interesting......\nThen I will see what I can do ~,

17,,,"Dracula woke up, \nit seems still at night, and she was sleeping in\nthe middle of road.",

24,,Witch,"Haha,\ndon't look me doubtfully,\nhere is my little rewards for you~",
25,,Witch,"Everyone, in the Halloween night,\nI want to host a lively event~\nLike candy dinner, or campus competition~",
26,,Saint,"Arena event? \nHmm, Halloween, \nsounds like a good day to conquer the campus.",
27,,Wildtress,Candies for winners?\nThen I'm in!,
28,,Witch,"So, please introduce the event to others~",
29,,Dracula,(Saint and Wildtress left)  This is your plan to\npromote Halloween? It seems no connection\nbetween special arena and Halloween.,
30,,Witch,"Remember, little vampire, people,\nwill be attracted by something rare.\nHowever, they will not accept it easily~",
31,,Witch,"First draw his attention,\nthen offers something he likes. It will be\nbetter acceptable and achieve your goals!",
32,,Dracula,"(then I will try to show myself, to attract the\nattention of the blood bag)",
33,,Dracula,Then I have to be the host of this arena~\nSo this pumpkin will be my premium price of this event.,
34,婚纱投票活動劇情,Librarian,"Senpai is really something. Ever since I gave him those notes, he doesn't come to the library often anymore.",
35,,Librarian,You promised me that you would share your stories with me!,
36,,Librarian,"Hmmph. If it weren't for that storybook you sent me later, I would have brought back my notebook...",
37,,Librarian,Just in time for the contest. Vote for me. You owe me.,
38,,Bud Elf,Senpai. Are you there? The door is open. Are you coming in?,
39,,Librarian,Hey! It's Bud Elf. What a coincidence. Long time no see.,
40,,Bud Elf,"Ah. Just a hunch, but I should have a few words with Susan. It's much easier for seniors to compete...",
41,,Librarian,"Hmm... Can it be that you're here to ask Senpai to vote for you, too?",
42,,Dracula,"Human... Even though they call you Senpai, are you going to refuse to vote for me?",
43,,*,"Dracula, I don't know exactly what you're talking about. Can you explain it to me?",
44,,Dracula,"Hmmph. You're being half-hearted with me again. Aren't you? The last time you said you would help me make the mocha flavor blood plasma, it was put on hold until now...",
45,,Dracula,Promise me first... Then I'll explain.,
46,,Bud Elf,Dracula... You're here too. Could it be that...,
47,,Dracula,It's Bud Elf and Librarian. It's great that you two came. I was just telling Senpai about the contest. You guys should vote for me too.,
48,,Librarian,Dracula... You need to look out for yourself for this event. Look at the situation. We are running against each other.,
49,,Bud Elf,"Don't mix things up, Dracula. You don't even need the prizes for this competition at all.",
50,,*,You guys. I am very happy that you two are here to see me. But...,
51,,*,What are you guys talking about? Voting? Contests? Prizes? Can you guys explain?,
52,,*,"What else did Dracula tell me just now about some boring activity without prizes? You're not talking about one thing, are you? Why is the atmosphere so tense?",
53,,Librarian,"Senpai, it seems you still don't know. After all, there are no updated records of this activity in my notes.",
54,,Librarian,"Hmmph. If you respect our agreement from before, you can come with me to the library right now. I'll tell you all about it.",
55,,Bud Elf,"Hmmph, the flower you promised to help me grow before has not been finished yet. Do not let Librarian fool you!",
56,,Dracula,"I may not need this stupid prize, but you mortals don't even deserve to compete with me.",

60,,,"Getting woken up by the noise, Lucifer left her bed and approached the door of her dorm.",
61,,Lucifer,(Yawning)…… Who's that?,
62,,Michael,"Happy birthday♪It's your birthday today, Lucifer♪",
63,,Lucifer,...!?Wut? Today is my birthday!?,
64,,Michael,"Hehe~ Knew that you might forget, but I won't!",
65,,Michael,Now guess what's in the gift box!,
66,,Lucifer,Toy bear? Orange cheese cookie? Or dancing doll?,
67,,Michael,Wrong~,
68,,Lucifer,"Am I…? Ah, whatever, Michael, just tell me what is inside!",
69,,Michael,Here! Open it yourself!,
70,,Lucifer,"Wow, an electric guitar! That's the best birthday present I can imagine!",
71,,Lucifer,"Thanks Michael, but still no hug even in this case!",
72,,Michael,"Well, it's fine by me if you like the gift! I never forgot to prepare it for you~",
73,,Michael,"Since you once said that everything could be a note, and when they come together and form a melody...",
74,,Lucifer,It will be my showtime!,
75,,Lucifer,"Michael, this Electric Guitar seems different from others~",
76,,Michael,Uh... I didn't notice that when I bought it?,
77,,Lucifer,Doesn't matter! It seems will inspire me more about the melody I'm going to play with it!,
78,,Lucifer,"Michael, let me have a try!",
79,,Lucifer,The handling is real good!,
80,,Lucifer,"Never thought I could get familiar with it so quickly! Nice pick, Michael!",
81,,Michael,Lucifer... It's loud enough to notice the Discipline Members…,
82,,Discipline Member,"Lucifer, I think it's necessary to notice that the 5th rule of dorm is not to make noise and bother other students!",
83,,Lucifer,"Haha, sorry! I was too excited so I forgot the rules! I will stop it right now!",
84,,Discipline Member,"This is absolutely not allowed! But since you've realized your fault, the punishment will only be writing a review on this.",
85,,Discipline Member,"I'll take the guitar for now, and we'll return this once you hand us your review!",
86,,Lucifer,Oh no… I was hoping for a better birthday!,
87,,Michael,I should've stopped you…,
88,,Michael,I'll help you to finish the review as I'm also responsible for this!,
89,,Lucifer,"It's so nice of you, Michael! I couldn't find a better friend other than you!",
90,,Michael,"Okay, now let's start writing!",
91,,Discipline Member,Enter!,
92,,Lucifer,Here's my review!,
93,,,Discipline Member took the paper and started to read.,
94,,Discipline Member,"Lucifer, I could read that you've fully understand the wrong point in this case.",
95,,Lucifer,Then can I have my guitar back? It really means a lot to me!,
96,,Discipline Member,Of course! But don't play it in dorm next time!,
97,,Lucifer,"Understood, I won't do that again!",
98,,Discipline Member,"By the way, the band audition of the Music Festival is about to begin!",
99,,Discipline Member,"As greatest celebration of music on campus, it has provided fame for many bands…",
100,,Lucifer,Music Festival…,
101,,Discipline Member,"Lucifer, although it was in the wrong place, but I should admit that you've played very well.",
102,,Discipline Member,I'm looking forward to see your band on the stage!,
103,,Lucifer,Thank you! I will lead my band and take the first place!,
104,Mass-election,Nani,Band audition!? We won't stand any chance!,
105,,Nani,"Lucifer, our band has just barely set up, and we still lack a…",
106,,Lucifer,Lack a drummer right?,
107,,Nani,"Exactly, now we're using the recorded drum sound in our works!",
108,,Nani,"If we do the same on Music Festival, it will be a disaster!",
109,,Lucifer,"Don't worry! That won't be a problem,",
110,,Lucifer,"But among all the new bands created this year, I believe we're the best!",
111,,Amazon,Agreed! None of our works is of vanity!,
112,,Amazon,"So we could let more know about us if we sign up,",
113,,Amazon,"In conclusion, advantages outweigh disadvantages!",
114,,Lucifer,"See, Amazon shares the same idea, what are you hesitating about?",
115,,Nani,"Fine, since you've made an agreement, let's give it a try.",
116,,Lucifer,Great! Let's go sign up!,
117,,Staff,"Everyone, get in the line! Keep in order! Next!",
118,,Amazon,Finally!,
119,,Lucifer,OK! We're coming!,
120,,Staff,"As you might have noticed, every band will need a name!",
121,,Lucifer,"Of course, we'd like to register our name as ""Shining""",
122,,Staff,It's been a long time since the last new band signed up.,
123,,Staff,"In that case, I will also need to know your position in the band.",
124,,Lucifer,"My name is Lucifer,  I‘m the lead singer and guitar player of the band! This is…",
125,,Amazon,"Name is Amazon, Bass player!",
126,,Nani,"You can call me Nani, the keyboard player!",
127,,Staff,"Alright, I've recorded your info! Please enter the waiting room and prepare for the show!",
128,,Lucifer,"Oh, there're so many candidates!",
129,,Amazon,"There're more candidates than predicted, seems we'll need to maximize our effort!",
130,,Nani,Check it out! The last band didn't make it… The judge is picky even for the mass election!,
131,,Judge,"Shining Band, it's time for you to start your performance!",
132,,Lucifer,It's our turn!,
133,,Lucifer,Stay sharp! We're the best!,
134,,Lucifer,(We've finally completed the performance! At least we're not too nervous to make big mistake.),
135,,Judge,"As a new band, you've really surprised me. But I've noticed that you used recorded sound for the drum playing part of the song…",
136,,Lucifer,"Well, actually we had a tough time in finding a drummer for our band.",
137,,Lucifer,"But drum playing is necessary for our work, so we'll at least need an alternative.",
138,,Judge,"I see, what a pity! There's a new rule restricts the record sound-tract in the annual Music Festival.",
139,,Lucifer,What!? Seriously?,
140,,Nani,"So, are we…?",
141,,Amazon,Not even able to pass the mass election!?,
142,,Judge,"Don't be too worried, the mass election will not end very soon, you can come here for another try if you could find a drummer for your band in time.",
143,,Nani,Finding a suitable drummer in limited time…,
144,,Amazon,"Even if we could, it will still take time for the recruit to run-in. It's impossible to do that!",
145,,Lucifer,"Thanks for the tip, see you next time, judge!",
146,Tech Girl,Lucifer,"Amazon, why so early?",
147,,Amazon,Music Store.,
148,,Lucifer,Then it's too early. We should get there after having enough rest!,
149,,Nani,"Currently most students on campus are interested in music, if we get there any later, there will be no effect left!",
150,,Lucifer,"Effect!? Amazon, you should've told me earlier!",
151,,Amazon,Short noticed.,
152,,Lucifer,Whatever… We need to be quick!,
153,,,"Once arrived, Lucifer and Amazon were attracted by the performance of electric drum.",
154,,,And the perfect work was produced by a known tech weeb--- Hexa.,
155,,Lucifer,Do I really know her?,
156,,Nani,Never knew Hexa is an expert in drum playing.,
157,,Amazon,"I could sense her solid basic skill in her performance, she might be the best drummer I've ever met.",
158,,Nani,That's awesome! I never thought the play of drum could be so wild…,
159,,Amazon,Watch closely! She knows even other skills…,
160,,Lucifer,We could use her! Hope she's not in a band already!,
161,,Nani,"I won't worry that much, Hexa spent most of her time in Lab.",
162,,Lucifer,Ain't that convenient? I'll definitely recruit her!,
163,,,The sound of the drum stopped without bodement.,
164,,,And the drummer starts to examine the drum head of the electric drum.,
165,,Hexa,"Strange... This drum head should perform better than its previous version, but…",
166,,Lucifer,"Hexa, I'm Lucifer, the lead singer and guitar player of Shining Band…",
167,,Hexa,Why? Was the liquid leaked in the lab wet its material?,
168,,Lucifer,Hexa? I'm talking to you!,
169,,Hexa,"Lucifer? Do you know it's impolite to interrupt others from thinking? I'm returning to the lab now, please step aside!",
170,,Lucifer,"Sorry for that! I was just kidding, I'd like to know if you're…",
171,,Hexa,"No, I'm not! Please step aside!",
172,,Lucifer,"I was impressed by your skill, please join our band!",
173,,Hexa,Why I could always meet crazy fans when I test the drum head? Don't feel bad on that though…,
174,,Lucifer,"I'm serious, and I'm not leaving until you agree!",
175,,Hexa,"Then cut the crap! Get out of my way, Lucifer!",
176,,Hexa,Unbelievable… Looks like I need to improve the power efficiency of the gauss pistol.,
177,,Nani,"Hexa, are you alright? Show me the wound if you have one.",
178,,Amazon,Sorry for that. Lucifer was pushy... maybe too pushy.,
179,,Lucifer,Hey! Why are you both ignoring your leader?,
180,,Amazon,"Hexa, I remember you are a big fan of Cola…",
181,,Nani,"And the producer of Cola happened to sponsor the Music Festival, if you join a band, you could have a discount~",
182,,Hexa,You should've told me that earlier! Let me join your band!,
183,,Lucifer,Why did I fight her again!?,
184,Another try,Nani,Today is the deadline for the mass election.,
185,,Amazon,It will be our last chance.,
186,,Lucifer,We need to do our best!,
187,,Hexa,Hey! You're running to fast! Wait for me!,
188,,Lucifer,"…Finally, we're here…",
189,,Amazon,The shortcut helps a lot…,
190,,Staff,Well… Excuse me…,
191,,Lucifer,We're here to sign up for the mass election!,
192,,Staff,"You are Shining Band, right? I remember you.",
193,,Lucifer,"Yes. We've recruited a good drummer, please record her in our band…",
194,,Staff,"But, the sign up for the mass election is over.",
195,,Nani,It's over!? Noooo…,
196,,Staff,"Sorry for that, but I'm afraid you will wait for the Music Festival next year.",
197,,Staff,"And the candidates this year are all very strong, even if you could pass the mass election, it will be hard for you to get the first place.",
198,,Staff,"So, just join the festival as audience this year~",
199,,Lucifer,No! We've trained a lot for this race. Please at least give us a chance!,
200,,Staff,"I could understand how you feel, but I don't have authority to do so…",
201,,Staff,"There, Gabriel is coming! You can ask her about this! She is the judge!",
202,,Lucifer,"Gabriel… Judge, hello! Do you still remember us? We're Shining Band!",
203,,Gabriel,"Of course, you left me a deep impression! Have you found a suitable drummer?",
204,,Nani,"Of course we do, but…",
205,,Amazon,"But unfortunately, the sign up was just over. Could you please help us? We really don't want to miss the chance!",
206,,Gabriel,"Well, I won't let any potential band lose their chance!",
207,,Lucifer,Thank you! Please enjoy our show!,
208,,Lucifer,"Judge,  have we passed?",
209,,Gabriel,"You barely completed the performance, but I was expecting more.",
210,,Amazon,I don't feel good…,
211,,Gabriel,"Don't worry that much, I haven't finished yet!",
212,,Gabriel,"What I want to say is, I saw potential in everyone of you… You've passed the mass election!",
213,,Gabriel,"Hope you could improve your privity. Just remember, it is more important than the skill of the instrument.",
214,,Hexa,We really passed?,
215,,Nani,Great! We made it!,
216,Privity Training,Nani,"Gabriel did said privity is important, but how can we improve it?",
217,,Amazon,"What we need is not some physical training, it's more like a link in mental…",
218,,Lucifer,That's too metaphysical! But I believe Hexa could explain that for us.,
219,,Hexa,"Well, I think , improving privity is a progress like inventing.",
220,,Nani,?,
221,,Lucifer,Come again?,
222,,Amazon,Sorry but I cannot understand you…,
223,,Hexa,"No matter how you think or talk, it will make less progress than giving it a try.",
224,,Hexa,"Practice is the sole criterion for testing truth, if you don't act, you will not succeed…",
225,,Nani,…Admiration arises despite my incomprehension of what you said.,
226,,Amazon,But what if we don't find out what we need even if we've tried?,
227,,Hexa,At least it's better than sitting ducks here!,
228,,Lucifer,"What about starting with the composition we all like? Since we could share the same admiration on it, we might just find the privity from it.",
229,,Nani,"But after all, what we will do is to complete our part!",
230,,Amazon,"I have a suggestion, maybe we could try to improvise.",
231,,Hexa(excited),Improvise!? Sounds really cool!,
232,,Lucifer,So what are we waiting for?,
233,,Lucifer,"Nah, that won't work. All I see is a mess.",
234,,Lucifer,"Hexa, you should lower the volume when it comes to my solo!",
235,,Hexa,"You should give out your microphone if you concentrate that much on playing the guitar, I just couldn't stand that any more!",
236,,Hexa,I think it will be much better if Amazon becomes our lead singer.,
237,,Amazon,Really? Are you serious? You're not kidding me right?,
238,,Nani,"(Oh no… It's not helping at all, if we continue the band will break up!)",
239,,Nani,Is there anyone want to join me and play board games? I think we need a relax after we've practiced this long.,
240,,Amazon,"Good idea! We shouldn't try to accomplish in an action, there's much time left.",
241,,Hexa,Then that's all for today. Where you think is proper for the board game?,
242,,Lucifer,"Alright, I went pushy again. Hexa, I think it's necessary to say sorry!",
243,,Hexa,"I don't forget easily, but I think Cola might be bad for my memory!",
244,,Lucifer,I will make you forget it today!,
245,Leader is not leading,Host,"Welcome to phase 2 of the band audition of the music festival, today, there'll be 3 bands stand out and play on the Stage of Music Festival.",
246,,Host,"As the largest annual celebration of music on campus, I believe all our candidates will hold nothing back.",
247,,Host,Now let's hear it for them!,
248,,Lucifer,Never thought it could be so breathtaking until now…,
249,,Nani,Someone help… My legs couldn't stop shaking…,
250,,Amazon,"Relax, imagine now yourselves in the practice room…",
251,,Hexa,But we don't have audience in the practice room.,
252,,Nani,"Take a look, it's The Peach. They’re considered the top seed of this year!",
253,,Lucifer,Their stability on stage during performance is beyond compare!,
254,,Amazon,How can we beat them?,
255,,Hexa,"Their sense on the rhythm is so good, at least I'm not that good.",
256,,Lucifer,They will be tough to beat…,
257,,Lucifer,But this is what we have to do!,
258,,Nani,That's the spirit!,
259,,Hexa,"It won't bother me, drummer is not the one audience will see first~",
260,,Amazon,"Yup, that'll surely work out for you.",
261,,Lucifer,Time to nut up or shut up!,
262,,,"For the first time on Stage, with so many audience watching, Lucifer became nervous, the this nervous consumed her memory on lyrics.",
263,,,"When Lucifer starts to sing with hesitation, her teammates noticed that something was happening.",
264,,,"Luckily, Amazon was able to react quickly and composed the part Lucifer forgot.",
265,,Lucifer,"Sorry, it's all my fault… I don't deserve to be the leader…",
266,,Nani,"Don't be sorry, we're all very nervous since it's our first show.",
267,,Hexa,"Besides, with the help of Amazon, the performance turned out to be a succeed.",
268,,Amazon,"We all know you have more pressure than us with the burden of the captain, just get over it.",
269,,Lucifer,…,
270,,,"But obviously, the consolation of the teammates didn't help, even worse, Lucifer felt more shame and ran away…",
271,Rematch,Lucifer,How can I be like this?,
272,,Lucifer,"As the lead singer, I‘m neglecting my duty…",
273,,Lucifer,"If we lose due to my mistake, how could I still be qualified for this position?",
274,,Amazon,"Finally! Lucifer, why are you here? We need to return to the preparation room!",
275,,Lucifer,"I'm sorry… You've all done so well, but I…",
276,,Amazon,"If you want to get to the next stage, just return with me!",
277,,Lucifer,??? What are you saying?,
278,,Amazon,"Our score is the same as the Monster Band, so there'll be a rematch to decide which band will enter the next round!",
279,,Lucifer,Then we still have a chance? You're not lying to me right?,
280,,Amazon,"Of course! Let's go, everyone is waiting for you!",
281,,Hexa,Lucifer is back!,
282,,Nani,"Lucifer, we've still got a chance~",
283,,Amazon,"Monster band is getting on the stage now, we don't have much time left!",
284,,Lucifer,"Sorry, I've failed you in the last song, this time I shall listen to you more!",
285,,Nani,"Lucifer, don't pressure on yourself too much, we will overcome that together!",
286,,Hexa,"Exactly, together as a team!",
287,,Nani,"Since the theme is still ""meeting"", I suggest using the new song.",
288,,Amazon,"Agreed! Lucifer could suffer less pressure during playing that song, and we could even spare our effort and interact with the audience.",
289,,Hexa,That's a nice idea!,
290,,Lucifer,That would also be my choice! I won't let you down this time!,
291,,Nani,Let's try our best!,
292,,Hexa,Hold nothing back!,
293,,Amazon,We'll win this!,
294,,Lucifer,Maximum effort!,
295,,Lucifer,"Finally! That's kind of relief! Thank you all, I'm not that nervous this time!",
296,,Nani,And you didn't forget the lyrics this time~,
297,,Hexa,I think we're better!,
298,,Amazon,"Agree, I've noticed the reaction of the audience during the song, and now we shall listen up, they're announcing the result!",
299,,Host,I thinkg we all have an answer! Shining Band is the one we'll still be able to meet next round!,
300,,Lucifer,Hooray--- We did it!,
301,,Hexa,Awesome!,
302,,Amazon,Thanks to Nani's bright idea~,
303,,Nani,"Thanks, but it's achieved by us all, together!",
304,Theme: Meeting,,"Lucifer wandered in the corridor, thinking the theme ""Meeting"" and the rhythm to fit in.",
305,,Amazon,"Lucifer, why are you still wandering, did you encounter any problem?",
306,,Lucifer,"Amazon, you come to me at the right time! I've just completed demo, try it out!",
307,,Lucifer,How do you feel?,
308,,Amazon,Hmmm...,
309,,Lucifer,"Do you sense something weird? I felt like you do too, but I don't know how to fix it… Uh, it's giving me a headache!",
310,,Amazon,"Lucifer, do you still remember the music you played offhand?",
311,,Lucifer,Do you mean the one you completed compose?,
312,,Amazon,That's right! I thing we can try to assimilate it into the new song.,
313,,Lucifer,Nice idea! I believe this could cover up the flaws!,
314,,Amazon,"By the way, since the theme is ""Meeting""? The song will become extremely suitable!",
315,,Lucifer,"You're right! But composing is never my strong points, besides, I'm too exhausted after completing the demo.",
316,,Amazon,"It's a hardwork, we'll need some creativity.",
317,,Lucifer,"Seems you have a good understanding, I shall leave the job to you~",
318,,Amazon,Well… Since you invited me because you admire my composition…,
319,,Lucifer,Glad you could understand!,
320,Outdoor training,Lucifer,"God, another full practice room! How many rooms have we failed to enter?",
321,,Amazon,This is the 7th!,
322,,Hexa,That's just overdoing... But why?,
323,,Nani,Of course the reason is the Music Festival~,
324,,Lucifer,"Since there's no available practice room, I suggest…",
325,,Hexa,Just tell us your idea!,
326,,Lucifer,"I suggest that we practice at the playground, this will help us overcome the nervousness when facing audience while collecting the feedback of our work.",
327,,Amazon,That's a great idea!,
328,,Hexa,Then what are we waiting for!,
329,,,"When Lucifer and her friends arrived at the playground, it was already filled with students.",
330,,,"The crowd was attracted by the performance of another band, looks like The Peach chose the same like Lucifer did.",
331,,Amazon,"They're also having the same idea, the playground is the perfect place for practicing and attracting new fans.",
332,,Nani,"The Peach has a good lead singers, she could easily lead the audience into her rhythm.",
333,,Hexa,Their drummer is also not bad! I'd challenge her if there's a chance!,
334,,Lucifer,"Hey, don't forget the reason we're here!",
335,,Lucifer,"Since we're both here to practice, let's consider it a warm-up match!",
336,,Lucifer,That's fun! I've not been so happy for a long time!,
337,,Hexa,Agreed! I want some more!,
338,,Nani,"Yet the sun goes down, and they're also leaving.",
339,,Amazon,Look! Their lead singer is coming towards us.,
340,,Hexa,Why she looks so serious?,
341,,Lucifer,"Don't worry, she won't eat us.",
342,,Sonya,"Hello! I'm Sonya, the lead singer of The Peach.",
343,,Lucifer,"Greetings, we're Shining Band, just call me Lucifer.",

347,,Sonya,Just take it! This is the coupon for my cafeteria. It doesnt' have an expiration date!,
348,Sonya's Cafeteria, ,"After the practice, members of Shining Band are hungry, so they decide to use the coupon of Sonya's Cafeteria.",
349,,Lucifer,"Sonya, what's your menu today? We're starving!",
350,,Sonya,"We're closed… Wait, it's you! Then forget what I just said! Come it!",
351,,Amazon,"Wow, what a surprise! I see musical instrument in your cafeteria, you use it as a practice room after it's closed?",
352,,Hexa,The cafeteria is 100% soundproofed. Who had this idea? She must be a genius!,
353,,KongMing,Thanks for your compliment!,
354,,Nani,And she is…?,
355,,Sonya,"Oh, I must forgot to introduce her! This is KongMing, the keyboard player of our band!",
356,,Joan,"I'm Joan, the Guitar player of the band.",
357,,Guan Yin,"Drummer, Guan Yin.",
358,,Hexa,"Guan Yin… The ""Goddess of War"" Guan Yin?",
359,,Guan Yin,No one shares the same name on campus.,
360,,Sonya,Stop! Not again! It's not the first time you get despicable because of this!,
361,,Guan Yin,So you have any problem with this? I think we can settle it down physically!,
362,,Lucifer,"You must have a very special relationship! By the way, I'm starving right now!",
363,,Sonya,"I've heard that you are also an experienced fighter, since you're here, why don't you take the honor and fight with Guan Yin?",
364,,Lucifer,…Wut? Are you serious about this?,
365,,Guan Yin,"Lucifer, please don't worry, I'll go easy on you.",
366,,Sonya,"Here's the dinner, if you have any suggestion, please just tell me!",
367,,Nani,"Wow, it smells real good!",
368,,Joan,"Sonya is expert in cooking, please enjoy!",
369,,Lucifer,These all taste so good!,
370,,,"A lot of talk was made during the dinner, the members of the 2 bands became friends who talked about everything.",

373,,Joan,"Thanks for the compliment, I'm just happened to pass here and improvised.",
374,,Sonya,"I didn't mean to interupt, but I don't want to miss some one who share the same interest in music.",
375,,Joan,Well? So you're also a fan in music?,
376,,Sonya,"To be honest, I failed to learn any muscal instrument,",
377,,Sonya,"But I believe I can sing well, and my voice should just become better accompanying with your guitar.",
378,,Joan,It's fine by me!,
379,,Sonya,"Haha, it's fun to be with you, I could never imagine there's some one who has a tacit understanding with me even it's the first time we meet!",
380,,Joan,I'm also feeling the same. What's your name by the way?,
381,,Guan Yin,My name is Guan Yin!,
382,,Sonya,！！！,
383,,Guan Yin,"Ah sorry for the shock, I was on my way to the cafeteria but got attracted by you, I did that without conciousness.",
384,,Sonya,"That's fine, as long as you also love music. I'm Sonya.",
385,,Joan,"Hello, my name is Joan.",
386,,Guan Yin,"I've noticed that you don't have a drummer, since I’m a little good at percussion, can I join you?",
387,,Sonya,That would be great! You are the kind of girl we need.,
388,,Guan Yin,"It's a pity that we don't have any percussion, but maybe I could use these drink bottles and paper box?",
389,,,"Guan Yin took 2 branches from a tree as her drum hammer, and used the paper box as her drum.",
390,,,"The music is finally finished, but the 3 girls are not, they continued to play until the day turns dark…",
391,,Joan,"It's my luck to meet you, it's already hard enough to meet 1 true friend in my life, but now I have got more, I'm so happy!",
392,,Guan Yin,"Since we find a bond between each other in music, what about build up a band together?",
393,,Sonya,That sounds great! Count me in!,
394,,Joan,"Very well! I'm also looking for such chance, it would be nice to team up with you!",
395,,Joan,"Well… We have full bloomed peach blossoms here, why don't we call ourselves ""The Peach""!",
396,Cheer up!,Lucifer,No wonder why you're so successful now after knowing how you meet. The music and the interaction of heart created your path.,
397,,Lucifer,"Now I know how to express the theme of this round, thank you Sonya!",
398,,Sonya,"I've done nothing, but good to know that you finally got an idea.",
399,,Lucifer,"Your story makes me understand more about friends and band, and I've got new inspiration now, see you on stage!",
400,,Lucifer,"Though we have different characteristic when playing music,",
401,,Lucifer,"But as long as we could march to the same goal together, we will succeed!",
402,,Hexa,Yes! This is what they call chemical reaction!,
403,,Amazon,I think no one can beat us now.,
404,,Nani,"But we should also remember, friendship first, competition later.",
405,,Lucifer,Here we go!,
406,,Host,Here is the site for the quarter-final! I'm glad that you're all here!,

420,,Nani,Our hardwork is finally paid off!,
421,,Host,Now let's have our bands return to the preparation area to get ready for the next round!,
422,,Sonya,I knew that you can make it!,
423,,Lucifer,"Thank you, we will not make it that easily if we didn't know your story!",
424,,Sonya,"You are surely embarassing me, don't be too humble.",
425,,Joan,"As a new band, you've already done very well for getting so far, I'm looking forward to see you in the next round!",
426,,Guan Yin,"We're all music lovers, so we shall share mutual encouragement!",

428,Meeting Romantic,Lucifer,"Genius arranging, tacit cooperation accompanied with the outstanding stage performance, they're too perfect…",
429,,Amazon,We will also become perfect as they are some day!,

434,,Lucifer,Wow! Another perfect show! I'm out of words...,
435,,Sonya,"Haha, we ain't that good, we're also looking forward to your performance!",
436,,Amazon,It's acutally outstanding.,
437,,Joan,"Thanks for your compliment, but don't look down on yourselves, the only thing you lack is experience.",
438,,Nani,"I'd consider it as a encouragement, we'll not let you down!",
439,,KongMing,"You've done very well as a new band, I'll be expecting more.",
440,,Guan Yin,The stage is yours now~,
441,,Hexa,It's show time!,
442,,Host,Outstanding! Another perfect show from a dark horse encouraged by their senior!,
443,,Host,We are probably witnessing the rise of a new band!,
444,,Lucifer,"This competition surely means a lot to me, I never knew there were so many short comings I should overcome.",
445,,Amazon,"This is what we call growing, after all, no pain, no gain.",
446,,Nani,"Agreed~ No matter how hard it is, we won't stop until reach our goal!",
447,,Hexa,So this means more hardwork needs be done in the following days~,
448,,Host,"After 2 rounds of fierce competition, the bands have all fully shown themselves on the stage, this is also the proof for their struggles and dreams!",
449,,Host,"Finally, it's time to announce the result!",
450,,Host,"Undoubtedly, The Peach successfully advanced to the next stage!",
451,,Host,"Of course, we'll also be able to expect for the dark horse Shining Band in the next stage!",
452,,Lucifer,(Excited) We did it!,
453,,Amazon,"Very well, we'll need to train harder then!",
454,,Nani,"Great, I knew we will succeed! There's nothing could stop us when we stand together!",
455,,Hexa,"(Pretends to be calm) About time, now we can finally return and drink cola~",
456,,Sonya,I knew you can make it!,
457,,Guan Yin,"It's good to know that,  see you on stage!",
458,,Joan,Good job!,
459,,Joan,"If you have any questions, you know where to find us.",
460,,Sonya,See you next time~,
461,,Amazon,I won't forget your help!,
462,,KongMing,"Don't mind that too much, that's what a friend should do.",
463,,Nani,What about having a meal together for the congratulations? Consider the payments on me.,
464,,Sonya,Good idea! It's nice to have a free meal… I mean a free talk about music~,
465,,Joan,Obedience is better than politeness in this case.,
466,,Lucifer,"Great, there's a lot I want to ask you!",
467,This is not a friend,Saint,"Huh? Someone's practicing guitar here? I thought  it was the sound of a crow, but doesn't matter, it sounds bad anyway.",
468,,Lucifer,"You there! Why you are so mean? Besides, it's none of your business!",
469,,Saint,"It's surely none of my business for you to practice, but this becomes personal since you're making noise.",
470,,Lucifer,Don't you know this is impolite?,
471,,Saint,You mean making noise and making others annoyed? This is the behavior I know as impolite.,
472,,Sapphire,This is enough! You're offending people.,
473,,Saint,"Fine, let's go practice, I will be killed if I listen to the noise anymore.",
474,,Lucifer,Hey!!!!,
475,,Sapphire,"Sorry for that, my friend just says whatever she wants, this always gets her in troubles, I hope you can accept my apology.",
476,,Lucifer,Who is she? And who are you? Do I know you?,
477,,Sapphire,"Calm down please , we actually were in the audition, and passed it.",
478,,Sapphire,"I'm Sapphire, the guitar player of Red, the band, the one there is Saint, the lead singer and the leader of the band.",
479,,Lucifer,"What? Someone like her is qualified to be a leader? Wait, you mean you are the guitar player of Red?",
480,,Sapphire,"Yes, it's me. I thought you've recognized me.",
481,,Lucifer,You are the guitar player who is known by the perfect solo play on the stage?,
482,,Sapphire,"Thanks for your compliment, it's just nothing. But since I'm here, I think it's necessary to remind you the mistakes you made.",
483,,Lucifer,"Of course I know there's something wrong, and that's why I'm here. But I just cannot find a solution, that's why I behaved so badly to Saint, sorry for that.",
484,,Sapphire,"It is unnecessary for your apology, it's literally her fault.",
485,,Sapphire,"I listened to your rehearsal, and in my opinion some parts of the song still have space for improval. Here, take a look at this.",
486,,Lucifer,That's a great idea! I should've known that! I will try it now!,
487,,Lucifer,It's all different now!,
488,,Sapphire,"These are crucial points, practice them to perfect, and your guitar skill will be improved greatly!",
489,,Lucifer,Thank you! It's so kind of you! But how could a girl so kind accept Saint as her captain?,
490,,Sapphire,"Haha, you're not the first person who asked this question. But you cannot just judge the person only by her appearance~",
491,,Sapphire,"Of course, Saint always offends others, but it's her method to encourage others, may be just too improper to be accepted.",
492,,Lucifer,So it's her pride making this happen? Strange.,
493,,Sapphire,"Since she's a member of us, we should embrace her, including the bad parts.",
494,,Sapphire,"Saint is gifted in music, so everyone knows her will admire her, and they all know she's actually a kind person.",
495,,Lucifer,Trust… forgiveness…(Seems I 've under stood more about friendship),
496,,Sapphire,"I also need to practice now, see you next time~",
497,,Nani,"Hey, Lucifer! Finally found you, you should have told us that you wanted to practice earlier.",
498,,Lucifer,"I think it's just my personal issue, as I don't want become a burden of the band.",
499,,Hexa,"The only issue for you in our band, is that my ice cola should be put into refrigerator again.",
500,,Amazon,"Don't forget, we're a team!",
501,,Lucifer,"I'm sorry! I won't do that again. By the way, I just met Sapphire from Red.",
502,,Nani,"Sapphire, that guitar master in the last round?",
503,,Lucifer,"Yes! Thanks to her, I've improved my skills and learned some new tricks, now let's start the practice…",
504,She's in our band!,Saint,"Never thought a band like this could also pass, seems you've improved a bit.",
505,,Nani,"It's the efforts of the whole band that brought us here today, not just mine. I'm also glad to see that you've passed this round too!",
506,,Saint,"It's easy for us, not even worthy to be mentioned, by the way, we recently had signed up for an event, we could use your help…",
507,,,"Seeing Saint is trying to recruit Nani, Lucifer went to them without hesitation…",
508,,Lucifer,Never!,
509,,Nani,Lucifer?! I didn't see you're here.,
510,,Lucifer,"I've been here for a while, just didn't want to interupt your conversation, but undermining the foundation of our band is not to be tolerated!",
511,,Nani,(It seems I mean a lot to Lucifer.),
512,,Saint,"It's so rude, is that how a leader worthy to be followed should behave?",
513,,Lucifer,"Nani is my friend, and she'll always be, so she's not coming with you!",
514,,Nani,Lucifer…,
515,,Saint,"You're restricting her freedom of choice! Our band is a better place for her,",
516,,Saint,"And if she joins us, we could achieve even more. You have no right to reject our offer for her!",
517,,Lucifer,I...,
518,,Saint,What? Now you stop talking? So just let Nani make her own decision.,
519,,Lucifer,"I know! No matter for Nani, Amazon or Hexa,  I'm always not a very qualified leader.",
520,,Lucifer,"But they still give their trust to me! And all I can do, is to improve myself to answer their trust,",
521,,Lucifer,"until one day I could be fitting my rank, and achieve our goal, this is my responsibility, and I will never stop!",
522,,Saint,"So, what do you say, Nani?",
523,,Nani,"Thanks for the invitation and offering me the chance,",
524,,Nani,"But now I have something more important to do, my band still have a race to prepare and practice, so…",
525,,Saint,"I understand, what a shame. Hope you could always remember what you said, Lucifer, you have a good team so don't fail them!",
526,,Nani,Lucifer…,
527,,Lucifer,"Sorry! It's all my bad, you deserve this opportunity.",
528,,Nani,"Don't say that, I chose, which means I've already give my trust to you! I believe Amazon and Hexa are the same.",
529,,Lucifer,But they're actually better. I'm your burden.,
530,,Amazon,Don't say that again. This is our choice and we won't regret that.,
531,,Hexa,Saint knows nothing! It's our decision to make you our leader!,
532,,Hexa,"She doesn't know how many efforts you did for the band, but we do.",
533,,Lucifer,…,
534,,Nani,So don't look down on yourself anymore! We'll be with you!,
535,,Lucifer,Thank you! I won't let you down!,
536,Lucifer lost her voice,,"At night, Lucifer found herself unable to fall asleep.",
537,,,"She couldn't stop thinking what happened in the morning, and the pressure becomes more. When she wakes up in the next morning…",
538,,Lucifer,...uh...!!!!!,
539,,,"Lucifer tried to speak, but she could barely make any voice.",
540,,,"She tried her best to make sound, but didn't succeed. It was at this moment that Lucifer knew, she lost her voice…",
541,,Nani,Why Lucifer is so late? She was always early. I can't wait to see her face after getting the gift.,
542,,Amazon,Maybe she didn't rest well from all the stress? But it will be no problem after she gets the present.,
543,,Hexa,Everyone could oversleep. Let's just wait some time longer.,
544,,,"After a while, Lucifer is still missing.",
545,,Hexa,Is it usual to oversleep this long?,
546,,Amazon,"I don't think so, this never happened before.",
547,,Nani,"Lucifer won't miss band practice without reason, is she sick?",
548,,Amazon,Huh? That could be a possibility.,
549,,Hexa,Let's just get to her dorm.,
550,,Nani,"Lucifer, are you here? We've waited for you a long time, so now we're here to check if anything happened.",
551,,Hexa,Do you still remember we need to practice today? We've been waiting for you for a long time.,
552,,,"Lucifer doesn't want her members to be worried, so she tried to pretend there's nothing wrong.",
553,,Lucifer,"Oh! It's you, sorry for being late! I was too tired yesterday, so I'll need to rest longer, just go ahead to practice and leave me alone.",
554,,Nani,"I see, is there anything wrong?",
555,,Lucifer,"Don't worry! I'm going to sleep, don't waste your time here!",
556,,Nani,"Well, then have a good rest.",
557,,Hexa,Don't you think Lucifer looks strange today?,
558,,Nani,"Yes, her voice sounded strange.",
559,,Amazon,And why she didn't let us in? We have not given out the present.,
560,,,"When the girls are in doubt, someone rushed out from the corner outside the dorm.",
561,,,"It was too fast for Hexa to react, so she got run down with the music box in her hand.",
562,,Hexa,"Hey, who's that! You broke our music box!",
563,,,The perpetrator left after leaving a short apology. But the girls didn't hear that as their mind were on the broken music box.,
564,,,"And when they realize that, it was already too late. So the girls decide to follow the perpetrator.",
565,,Hexa,You there! Why you left without excuse after breaking our present!,
566,,Nani,"Wait, are you Lucifer's friend? I've met you before, I'm Nani , a member of her band.",
567,,Hexa,"I'm Hexa, the drummer of the band. Sorry for the rudeness.",
568,,Amazon,"Amazon, Bass player.",
569,,Michael,"So you're the teammates of Lucifer, my name is Michael. I was in a rush to send this medicine, I didn't mean to break your music box, sorry for that.",
570,,Nani,Medicine? Who is that for?,
571,,Michael,"Lucifer didn't tell you? She lost her voice this morning, so she asked me to bring her medicine to fix this.",
572,,Amazon,What???,
573,,Hexa,She lost her voice?!,
574,,Nani,Lucifer! Why don't you just tell us the truth!,
575,,Lucifer,(low voice) How do you…?,
576,,Hexa,"Don't bother, what we want to know is the reason you don't tell us the truth.",
577,,Lucifer,"Sorry, I didn't take good care of myself...",
578,,Hexa,"Don't be sorry for that, you're just making us worried.",
579,,Amazon,"You just put all the pressure on yourself, it's impossible to keep healthy with all those pressure!",
580,,Hexa,"Yes, we're a band, we should solve the problems together as a team!",
581,,Nani,"The pressure must comes from the race. Honestly, we built the band for fun, you shouldn't mind that too much.",
582,,Hexa,"That's right, I don't care the result either, that's not what we truely need!",
583,,Amazon,"Health comes first, we're also having a tough time in the past few days, why don't we rest a while and help Lucifer to recover?",
584,Truth or Dare,Nani,"Boring! We cannot practice, and Lucifer is not available for Karaoke~",
585,,Amazon,"I know you have energy to spend, but it's just not the right time.",
586,,Nani,"But since we're staying idle here, why don't we play games?",
587,,Amazon,Game? What game?,
588,,Nani,How about Truth or Dare?,
589,,Amazon,Uh… It's not fun at all! But at least better than doing nothing!,
590,,Hexa,"I'll take the first turn. Amazon, what's your description about me?",
591,,Amazon,"Well… Techweeb, cola freak…",
592,,Hexa,Hey! That's not a complete answer!,
593,,Amazon,"I don't care, I've expressed my real thought, now it's my turn to ask you, Hexa!",
594,,Amazon,What's the craziest thing you've ever done?,
595,,Hexa,Uh… Drink up a box of cola in a day?,
596,,Amazon,Seriously?,
597,,Hexa,"Now you know how I felt when you answered, besides, that's a crazy thing to be done~ Lucifer, it's your turn!",
598,,Lucifer,"Nani, how does Saint know you?",
599,,Nani,"Oh, Saint, we also know each other because of music, and she admires my skill. Saint is the kind of girl who admires all those talented.",
600,,Nani,"So she's not actually humiliating you, that was just an encouragement in her method.",
601,,Lucifer,Sapphire told me the same…,
602,,Hexa,"By the way, who do you like more as the lead singer? Saint or Lucifer?",
603,,Nani,Lucifer of course!,
604,,Lucifer,(Loud) Nani!,
605,,,"Although it's a simple answer, Lucifer still sensed the teammates' trust.",
606,,Hexa,"Lucifer, your voice?!",
607,,Lucifer,"What? Wait, my voice is back!",
608,,Nani,"Awesome! Lucifer, your voice is finally back!",
609,,Lucifer,"I can't wait to sing, let's go practice right now!",
610,,Amazon,Let's go! We've been waiting for too long!,
611,,Hexa,"Finally! But, did we rest for a long time?",
612,The movement of friendship,Hexa,Done! This is perfect for the race~,
613,,Amazon,"With more practice, there will be no problem!",
614,,Nani,Then let's start the practice~,
615,,Lucifer,……,
616,,Nani,"What? Lucifer, you look worried, is there anything wrong with the song?",
617,,Lucifer,It's perfect.,
618,,Amazon,Then is there anything needs to be improved when we play it?,
619,,Lucifer,You've done very well.,
620,,Hexa,Then what's the problem?,
621,,Lucifer,It's… about me… I'm afraid the issue on our first show might just happen again…,
622,,Nani,So you're worried about being nervous and forget the lyrics... But this didn't happen in the past 2 rounds.,
623,,Lucifer,"But this round is more important, I don't want there's a possibility for accident…",
624,,Amazon,"That's true, now our opponents are becoming harder to beat. To ensure we beat them, we'll need a better plan.",
625,,Hexa,"I remember when we first on stage, Amazon composed the part Lucifer forgot.",
626,,Hexa,"If Amazon could do the same successfully if the same issue happen again, there could be nothing else we need to worry about.",
627,,Amazon,I'm okay with that.,
628,,Nani,"Then that's it, let's practice some more!",
629,,Lucifer,Okay! Thanks for taking that into consideration.,
630,,Amazon,"Never mind, you're not the only one wants to sing.",
631,,Host,"Here we meet again, welcome to the semi-final of the Music Festival!",
632,,Host,"This round will decide which bands will meet in the final, and we're still using the score match to decide the result!",
633,,Host,Now let's welcome the candidates!,
634,,Host,"First of all, it's our top seed: The Peach!",
635,,Nani,We're not the only band which is improving themselves of course!,
636,,Lucifer,"There's always something new to discover, The Peach is surely worthy of the name.",
637,,Host,It's full score! The Peach provided us a perfect show! Coming up next : Shining Band !!!,
638,,Lucifer,"I'm getting too nervous, thank goodness we've got a better plan, Amazon, we're counting on you.",
639,,Amazon,"Don't worry, leave it to me!",
640,,Nani,Fight~ We will make it!,
641,,Hexa,Let's start the show~,
642,,Lucifer,Here we go!,
643,,Host,"As expected, the final result is not bad, no matter what will happen today, we could say Shining Band has a promising future!",
644,,Lucifer,"I really forgot the lyrics, but we're luck to have a plan B.",
645,,Amazon,"Don't worry, according to the feedback from the audience, the backup plan turns out to be a success.",
646,,Hexa,"Yes, it seems even better than completing the song alone!",
647,,Nani,All thanks to our effort on practicing this!,
648,,Host,"After the fierce competition, now we have a list for the bands who can enter the finals!",
649,,Host,The winner is--- The Peach! Red! And…,
650,,Host,And...,
651,,Lucifer,…,
652,,Host,Shining Band! Congratulations!,
653,,Lucifer,We made it!,
654,,Amazon,Our hardwork is not in vain!,
655,,Nani,Great!,
656,,Hexa,I'll need a box of cola after all this!,
657,Power Failure?!,Host,"Nice to see you, and welcome to the final of the audition for Music Festival.",
658,,Host,"Tonight, all the candidates will try their best to earn their tickets to perform on the stage of Music Festival.",
659,,Saint,"Check it out! Is that ""Captain Crow""? You must have spent much effort to get here~",
660,,Lucifer,That's right! And we'll not stop here!,
661,,Saint,"If the competition is about bragging, you've already won~",
662,,Lucifer,"It doesn't work for me anymore, Saint, I won't be affected by you!",
663,,Saint,"I'm just telling the truth, this is the final competition, and it cannot be won only by luck.",
664,,Amazon,You mean all the achievement we made is because of luck?,
665,,Saint,"Luck counts partly of your whole strength, but the part is too big for you!",
666,,Nani,"Enough! We know that we still have shortcomings, but don't ever say that anymore!",
667,,Saint,"Okay~ It's about time, see you on stage~",
668,,Sapphire,"Sorry for that, I cannot help to change how Saint behaves, please just ignore her.",
669,,Lucifer,"It's okay, this is not the first day we know her.",
670,,Sapphire,"You've proved yourselves for coming this far, it's very rare for a new band to reach the final.",
671,,Sapphire,"Now it's our turn, I'll be watching your performance coming up next~",
672,,Hexa,"Why could two individuals who have completely different characteristics form such a great team, it's almost magic!",
673,,Host,"Coming up next, is our annual black horse, Shining Band!",
674,,Lucifer,"Finally, hold nothing back! We can do this!",
675,,Nani,"Of course, we've prepared a lot for this moment!",
676,,,"When the performance almost reach its climax, the music stopped and the stage turned to dark. It's a power failure!",
677,,Lucifer,(Unfortunate… This is the end…?),
678,,,"Facing the accident, Lucifer can't help to become depressed…",
679,,,"When she almost start to cry, there's a hand tapped her shoulder.",
680,,,It's Amazon. Lucifer sensed determination and encouragement from her behavior…,
681,,,"After communicating with her band with several gestures, Lucifer started to play the guitar, she will finish her performance.",
682,,,"This surely earned the applause of the audience, the site suddenly becomes quiet so that the voice of Lucifer could be heard in the entire venue.",
683,,Saint,"This band, interesting…",
684,,Sapphire,"That's why we do it, isn't it?",
685,Festival in Rain,Lucifer,"Finally, the today is Music Festival!",
686,,Nani,My heart is beating too quick...,
687,,Amazon,Let's do it!,
688,,Hexa,I can wait no longer!,
689,,Lucifer,Let's go! For our dreams!,
690,,Host,"Finally, it's Music Festival today, the 3 bands passed the audition will provide us their best performance,",
691,,Host,"Undoubtedly, there will be a great show today, now let's start the music!",
692,,Host,"First coming out, is The Peach, as the band got the highest score in the audition, let's see what they've prepared for us!",
693,,Amazon,"We've earned the right to stand on stage, why are you still here?",
694,,Saint,"Haha, you really made it. You must be having a hard time to complete your performance with the electricity is cut off, maybe I was wrong about you.",
695,,Hexa,That goes without saying. Looks like someone need to check if her ability in judging people is still serving her correctly~,
696,,Lucifer,"I've heard a lot about you from Nani and Sapphire, I know you just cannot correctly express your caring.",
697,,Saint,"Haha, now you're talking? Interesting, just consider you're having a normal performance when it's your turn, don't forget your lyrics this time~",
698,,Lucifer,"Well, this care is still too mean for me...",
699,,,"After the performance of The Peach and Red, it starts to rain.",
700,,Lucifer,Seriously? I thought the power failure last time was bad enough.,
701,,Nani,But maybe we can take advantage from it.,
702,,Amazon,"I remember we've made a song about rain, it will surely fit this weather~",
703,,Hexa,"Great idea, it surely will work!",
704,,Lucifer,Alright! That's what we call improvisation~,
705,,,"The rain didn't stop, but it didn't affect the performance.",
706,,Audience,Encore! Encore! Encore!,
707,,Host,"Outstanding! Now it's the end of the planned performance, but it's not the end of our love for the music! The rain won't stop it either!",
708,,Host,"I heard your call, and it's your lucky day, Shining Band is now coming back to stage!",
709,,,"With the request of encore made by the audience and host, Lucifer led her band back to the stage.",
710,,Lucifer,Thanks for your support!,
711,,Lucifer,"Of course, I will not forget how The Peach helped us out of most troubles we met.",
712,,Lucifer,"And Red, thanks to their very special method to encourage me, I've learnt a lot from you.",
713,,Lucifer,"Finally, I cannot forget my teammates, they're my most important friends in this, nothing can be done without them.",
714,,Lucifer,"And now, we're finally here.",
715,,Lucifer,"So, at this moment, I really hope The Peach and Red could stand up on the stage, and finish the performance together!",
716,,,"And the two bands didn't let Lucifer down, they performed together and started their party.",
717,,,"Meanwhile, the sky has cleared, and a rainbow hangs above the stage...",
718,Training Result,,Several days after defeating Chaos Lord 「Dire」…,
719,,,The Academy renovation is complete. It's just like the Chaos Lord never came.,
720,,,On a normal afternoon---,
721,,*,I can sleep as long as I like now~ That's so nice~,
722,,*,"No Linky's Minion, no Terror Figure, no Chaos Lord...",
723,,*,It feels so good when there's nothing to worry about~,
724,,,"(Suddenly, the doorbell is rings)",
725,,*,Who's that?,
726,,？？？,Take a guess~,
727,,*,Is that Aquaris?,
728,,？？？,Nope! Try again.,
729,,*,KongMing…?,
730,,？？？,No!!! You don't recognize my voice?!,
731,,*,"Iro--- aww, I'm tired of guessing!",
732,,Iron Fist,"Senpai, you knew it was me from the beginning!?",
733,,*,It's about time you showed up...,
734,,Iron Fist,Then why did you intentionally give the wrong answers?,
735,,*,"Haha, I just wanted to hear your reactions!",
736,,*,"Besides, you also look very cute when you're embarassed~",
737,,Iron Fist,"Senpai, do you know?",
738,,*,Know what?,
739,,Iron Fist,"In the time we've been training with Ithil, I've learned something about myself.",
740,,*,What's that?,
741,,Iron Fist,Well---,
742,,Iron Fist,I also look cute when I'm beating someone!!,
743,,Iron Fist,"Senpai, please check the results of my special training!!",
744,,*,Can I politely decline?,
745,,Iron Fist,Guess.,
746,,Iron Fist,(Gasp)… I… I lost again…,
747,,Iron Fist,Senpai is strong as usual…,
748,,*,(Gasp)… You've also become stronger!,
749,,*,Your efforts have paid off!,
750,,Iron Fist,I've been training so hard with Ithil...,
751,,Iron Fist,How can you become so strong without any training? This doesn't make sense!,
752,,？？？,You two are too hard on yourselves. Not everyone will practice early in the morning.,
753,Four Patients,Iron Fist,Turin~,
754,,*,"Turin, I didn't even notice you there~",
755,,Turin,I didn't want to interrupt your conversation. Thought it would spoil the mood.,
756,,*,"Don't worry, you're already one of the Girls!",
757,,*,Maybe we should practice again just to make sure...,
758,,Iron Fist,"Alright, enough. It's about time to leave now~",
759,,Turin,"So, you were training with Ithil recently?",
760,,Iron Fist,That's right! Ithil wasn't satisfied with our performance during the last battle.,
761,,Iron Fist,So she encouraged many students to get additional training.,
762,,*,And you can plainly see the results!,
763,,Iron Fist,"It's exhausting, though…",
764,,Iron Fist,"Ithil has very high standards, so this is the first time I've had a chance to relax in since the training started!",
765,,Iron Fist,"Otherwise, I would have come to the Healthcare Room much earlier…",
766,,*,"After all, Michael and Lucifer are our friends…",
767,,*,But even Linky and Kratos are in a coma. This is worrying.,
768,,Iron Fist,It's already surprising enough to have them back on campus.,
769,,Iron Fist,But why… Have they been sent back to the Healthcare Room soon after that?,
770,,Turin,Well… That's how things went---,
771,,Turin,"KongMing… Although they've lost their memories, they still managed to re-enter the academy. Is this even necessary?",
772,,KongMing,"However, rules are rules. They have to face the examiners again for this.",
773,,KongMing,"Afterwards, they are free to choose any House to enter.",
774,,Turin,But what if their choices are different…,
775,,KongMing,"It won't matter. Besides, I need to prove something…",
776,,KongMing,Are you ready? The preliminary test is about to begin.,
777,,Michael,I'm ready. Thank you for your time.,
778,,Lucifer,"Tch, it's about time. Hope the examiners are worth the wait!",
779,,KongMing,"Now, please fight against the examiners and decide which House you want to join after that.",
780,,Michael,Thanks again for your time!,
781,,Lucifer,Bring it on!,
782,,KongMing,"Very well. The test is over. Now, have you decided which House you're going to enter?",
783,,Michael,"I'm impressed by everyone's abilities so far, but I still believe I would fit in with House Angel better than the other Houses.",
784,,Lucifer,Nothing worth mentioning…,
785,,Lucifer,But I can still allow House Demon to stand with me…,
786,,KongMing,I see… I'll arrange your entrance to the two houses that you chose immediately.,
787,,Turin,Luckily… They both chose the original Houses they used to belong to.,
788,,KongMing,"I don't think it's because of luck… No matter how many times they choose, the consequence will be the same.",
789,,Turin,...Huh?,
790,,KongMing,The test is over. You can return to your dorm now.,
791,,Lucifer,I don't want to finish yet!,
792,,Michael,Uh… Something's… Wrong…,
793,,KongMing,What happened…?,
794,,Turin,"They are weaker than before,",
795,,Turin,But the power they just showed was overwhelming…,
796,,Turin,It must be their control of power got overwhelmed by the surge made them passed out.,
797,,Iron Fist,"So, Michael and Lucifer…",
798,,Turin,They've lost their memories.,
799,,*,"No matter what, it's still fortunate to have them both back alive…",
800,,*,"Ah, here we are! The Healthcare Room is just ahead!",
801,The Doctor,Michael,……,
802,,Lucifer,……,
803,,Linky,……,
804,,Kratos,……,
805,,*,So they're separated into two rooms? All we have to do now is wait until they're awake.,
806,,*,"But if the 4 wake up at the same time, that will be real fun~",
807,,Iron Fist,"But, Linky deserves her name as a Valkyrie.",
808,,Iron Fist,"Even after receiving a wound that is that serious, she still managed to secure Kratos… That's tough…",
809,,*,"But her will couldn't support a broken body… Had we not find them in a coma at the gate and sent them here, they would've never made it out alive.",
810,,Iron Fist,Whether it was Linky's assault or Kratos's treachery…,
811,,Iron Fist,They were both driven by some kind of strong will that Dire used to further her interest…,
812,,Iron Fist,What a shame. They were tricked and used by the Chaos…,
813,,*,"Since Turin has gained self-awareness, I think Kratos's plan won't be necessary for her anymore?",
814,,*,"If they admitted their faults and helped us defend the campus, that would've been really nice…",
815,,*,"Turin, what do you think?",
816,,*,Turin?,
817,,Turin,"Oh… Yes, I'm listening! Senpai, what do you want to say?",
818,,*,What does Kratos mean to you?,
819,,Turin,I don't know how to describe it… Everything that she did was for me…,
820,,Turin,"But what she did was unforgivable, I don't even know how to deal with her after she wakes up…",
821,,*,(Maybe this kind of issue is just too hard to sort out for someone who just gained her own emotion like Turin,
822,,*,Just follow your heart. Just like Phoenix~,
823,,*,She is expecting a duel after Kratos recovers~,
824,,Turin,Well… It's easy to think that like that…,
825,,？？？,"Hehe, the Healthcare Room is getting busy lately.",
826,,Raphael,"Got four new patients almost at the same time, and the issues with the patients from before haven't been solved…",
827,,Raphael,Looks like I'm getting busier and busier as a doctor on campus!,
828,,*,"Raphael, I'm sorry for troubling you.",
829,,Raphael,Don't worry! That's my responsibility.,
830,,Raphael,They will be fine once they take several days of rest.,
831,,Raphael,"But I'm actually worried about you, Iron Fist! If you keep training this hard, you'll ruin your body!",
832,,Iron Fist,What? Me?,
833,,Raphael,That's right. Don't you remember how weak you were when you first arrived at the Academy?,
834,,Raphael,Even your prosthetic arm can't even withstand that much training.,
835,,Iron Fist,But I'm fully recovered! And I've been taking care of the prosthetic arm that KongMing crafted every day.,
836,,Iron Fist,I can still take it~,
837,,Raphael,Is that true? Then let me examine your body~,
838,,Iron Fist,Don't say that! That's weird!!!,
839,,Raphael,That's right! Don't move!!,
840,,Iron Fist,Ah! It hurts!,
841,,Raphael,See? That's what I'm talking about. You've trained way too much! Lay off the training!,
842,,Iron Fist,"B-but, I don't want to waste Ithil's---",
843,,*,"Don't bother. Turin, please take Iron Fist back to rest.",
844,,Turin,What are you going to do?,
845,,*,I think I'll need to have a talk with Ithil.,
846,,*,She should be in Valeera's library right now…,
847,,Raphael,Remember to mention what Raphael said~ That should increase the chance of convincing her.,
848,,*,「Sister」？,
849,,Raphael,Huh? Do you have any other ideas?,
850,,*,No… Absolutely not. I'm leaving.,
851,,Raphael,(Iron Fist and her prosthetic arm… How much more can she take? I'll need to tell KongMing about this),
852,Breach into the Library,*,(Ithil comes to the Grand Library too often recently. Is she checking something?),
853,,*,(I still remember the guardians. They will attack whoever enters without any authorization),
854,,*,"(Hopefully, Valeera added me into the whitelist...)",
855,,Guardian,Warning! Warning! Unauthorized personnel detected!!!,
856,,*,"Again!? Uh, don't you still remember me?",
857,,Guardian,Warning! Warning! Unauthorized personnel detected!!!,
858,,*,"We had a good fight last time. As an old saying goes... ""Fights can lead to friendship…""",
859,,Guardian,Warning! Please leave this property immediately!,
860,,*,Damn… Can't you at least tell Valeera that I was here?,
861,,Guardian,Reservation request confirmed. Adding to reservation queue.,
862,,*,"Uh, that's also a solution…",
863,,Guardian,Request confirmed. EWT：89 Hours and 32 Minutes,
864,,*,How could it take so long!,
865,,Guardian,The timer is set by the administrator. Thanks in advance for your understanding.,
866,,*,I'd rather believe she made this so new visitors won't be able to see her.,
867,,*,This is urgent. I must enter now!,
868,,Guardian,Warning! Warning! Unauthorized personnel detected!!!,
869,,*,"…If that's the case, I'll have to just break in!",
870,,*,"Sorry, I'll let Valeera fix you later, and also let her add a communication mod~",
871,New suggestion,*,(I heard Valeera volunteered to keep records of Yume Academy).,
872,,*,(If Ithil is keeping herself busy and happens to find the time to rush in here…),
873,,*,(Could it be that Valeera found something very important)?,
874,,*,"(But it's great, that they found Iron Fist---)",
875,,,I couldn't stop thinking about it when I'm going forward. Until I heard something.,
876,,？？？,Only the… Antique… Can…,
877,,？？？,Investigate the… D.E.F… That is known…,
878,,Ithil,Who's there---,
879,,Ithil,It's kind of rude to eavesdrop!,
880,,*,"Stoooop--- Ithil, it's me!",
881,,Ithil,Why are you here...? Have you heard anything?,
882,,*,I haven't heard anything…,
883,,*,"No, I mean. I wasn't eavesdropping…",
884,,Ithil,…Whatever. You'll know about this sooner or later. All you need to do is to keep your mouth shut.,
885,,*,Then when can I know about this?,
886,,Ithil,When the time comes.,
887,,Ithil,Let's forget about it for now. Why are you here?,
888,,*,I'm here for you.,
889,,Valeera,Thought you might be here for me~ Kind of disappointed~,
890,,*,"Oh, I'll also need your support for this!",
891,,Valeera,Oh really? You're not just trying to comfort me?,
892,,Ithil,"Alright, cut the crap. What do you want?",
893,,*,"Ithil, I think you've been overdoing it on the special training lately.",
894,,Ithil,So the girls are complaining to you now?,
895,,*,"No, they didn't say anything, but their bodies couldn't stand the intensity of the training.",
896,,Ithil,What? I never thought they could be so weak...,
897,,*,"When Iron Fist and I went to the Healthcare Room to visit Michael, we also met Raphael.",
898,,*,She said if Iron Fist keeps doing what she is doing…,
899,,Valeera,I think we should listen to Raphael. We can trust her medical expertise.,
900,,Valeera,"Anyhow, not everyone is as strong as you, Ithil.",
901,,Ithil,So that's how it is. I understand. I've been too pushy.,
902,,Ithil,But Iron Fist did ask for higher intensity training.,
903,,*,Huh? Why is she so strict to herself?,
904,,Ithil,You still don't get it? Are you really that…,
905,,Ithil,"OK, I'll consult with Raphael for the next training schedule.",
906,,*,"Ah, that's good.",
907,,Ithil,"But, I have another plan---",
908,,Ithil,A visit to the hot spring! How about that?,
909,Vacation!!!,*,That's the whole story.,
910,,*,Ithil hopes you can take a trip to the hot spring and relax.,
911,,KongMing,It makes sense. Everyone is worn out. Just chill out.,
912,,KongMing,If Raphael didn't notice any issues with Iron Fist's physical health…,
913,,*,I will keep that in mind for the next few days. Don't worry.,
914,,KongMing,I'm not worrying about that~,
915,,KongMing,I'm also not worried about how you're going to do anything strange on the trip!,
916,,*,But you don't have to say it like that!,
917,,KongMing,I think it is necessary for you to hear it!,
918,,KongMing,"Ok, I was joking~ I'll tell everyone about it on campus.",
919,,*,You can join us if you want!,
920,,KongMing,"So, you're trying to get me to join in on the fun too?",
921,,*,Why do you always thinking about such weird things!,
922,,KongMing,"Sorry, you acted like some kind of hentai before. I couldn't help it~",
923,,*,「Hentai」? Seriously?,
924,,KongMing,What do you think?,
925,,*,"Uh, Iron Fist didn't notice the dark-side of you, didn't she?",
926,,KongMing,"As the current president of the Student Union, I don't think I have anything that other students cannot learn from.",
927,,KongMing,"After all, the academy will have a bleak future if everyone is like Senpai~",
928,,*,"I know you're joking, but why do I feel there is some kernel of truth in what you say…",
929,,KongMing,Sorry that I made you feel that way. You've been very reliable lately~,
930,,*,That's right. Wait---,
931,,*,We were off the topic! Are you sure you're not coming with us?,
932,,KongMing,"No, I've got something important to do~",
933,,*,Still got many things to do?,
934,,KongMing,That's right! I'll need to arrange the campus renovations and Joan will be inaugurated as the interim leader of the Discipline Committee.,
935,,KongMing,"With Michael and Lucifer entering campus again, it's more troublesome than you can imagine.",
936,,KongMing,And most importantly…  Don't forget...,
937,,*,Making the campus safe…?,
938,,KongMing,"That's right. The recent accidents are becoming too frequent, so we have reasons to believe the campus is becoming less safe…",
939,,KongMing,Measures must be taken…,
940,,*,"Then, I'd better stay and assist you.",
941,,KongMing,"Thank you, but it won't be necessary. I can handle it.",
942,,KongMing,"Besides, it's also important to help with the girls' morale. So just go then. The girls will need you.",
943,,*,"Okay? If you need any help, just ask.",
944,,KongMing,"Relax, I won't hesitate if it matters. Now, go relax at the hot spring~",
945,,*,"Okay, I will go start the preparation now.",
946,,KongMing,"By the way, there's one more thing.",
947,,KongMing,......,
948,,KongMing,(Should I tell him more about Iron Fist?),
949,,KongMing,(But Iron Fist is sensitive and Senpai isn't the kind of person who can keep a secret...),
950,,KongMing,"(Forget it, I'd better not tell him when they're enjoying themselves)",
951,,KongMing,…Just take good care of Iron Fist.,
952,,*,"Okay, I will.",
953,Sign Up,KongMing,Iron Fist… Turin… Guan Yin…,
954,,KongMing,They're very excited… Just as we predicted~,
955,,Psychic,KongMing~,
956,,KongMing,"Psychic, are you also going to the hot spring?",
957,,Psychic,Yes!!! Rumpy and Bruno are also looking forward to this trip~,
958,,KongMing,That battle must have terrified them.,
959,,Psychic,Bruno is okay. But Rumpy got a little bit… Too excited!,
960,,Psychic,"If I haven't stopped him, I'm sure he will charge directly at the Chaos Lord!",
961,,KongMing,"Thanks to you, he's more energetic than he used to be~ I can still remember how weak he was when---",
962,,Psychic,Hey! Wait for me!!,
963,,？？？,Meow~Meow~Meow！！,
964,,Psychic,Don't worry! I'm from the Animal Welfare Club~ You're in good hands now~,
965,,Bruno,Woof! Woof! Woof!,
966,,Psychic,"Bruno, don't bark！You might scare him!",
967,,Hunter???,Meeeeeeow!,
968,,Psychic,Huh?,
969,,Psychic,You're strong… A normal cat could never do this…,
970,,Hunter???,(Growl)…,
971,,Psychic,"But, you must be tired! Here, take some cookies~",
972,,Hunter???,Meow?,
973,,Psychic,"This is a Servant Cookie that I made, you'll love it.",
974,,Psychic,"Not only is it delicious to servants, but also to humans as well… (NOM NOM)…",
975,,Psychic,…Crap! These are prepared for you.,
976,,Hunter,(Chewing)...,
977,,Psychic,"It's really good, right? How about staying with me from now on? So you won't have to worry about your own safety anymore.",
978,,Psychic,"Ah, you need a name… How about Rumpy?",
979,,Bruno,Woof…,
980,,Psychic,"Oh, you also want some cookies? Here you go!",
981,,Hunter,Meow！,
982,,Psychic,"Hey, Rumpy! You don't need to steal from Bruno!",
983,,Psychic,"Haha, he made a lot of trouble when he first arrived on campus~",
984,,KongMing,"If he wasn't so naughty, he wouldn't appear on campus alone.",
985,,Psychic,"Oh, I almost forgot the hot spring trip sign-up!",
986,,KongMing,"Don't worry, your name is already on the list~",
987,,Psychic,"By the way, are you also coming with us?",
988,,KongMing,"With Ithil and Valeera leading... and Senpai, it won't be necessary for me to come with you~ Since I've got a lot of work to do...",
989,,Psychic,Then I'll stay…,
990,,KongMing,"Hehe… Your reaction is just like Senpai's~ Don't worry, things are not that bad.",
991,,KongMing,I'm just worrying for no reason.,
992,,KongMing,"You wouldn't want to miss the chance of taking a trip. As you've mentioned before, Rumpy and Bruno are also looking forward to it~",
993,,Psychic,Alright… We'll be right back!,
994,,KongMing,Remember to meet at the gate at 7:00 tomorrow~,
995,Familiar Smell,Aquaris,Wow~ So many people!,
996,,*,Looks like everyone is looking forward to it~,
997,,Iron Fist,All thanks to Ithil for reminding me!,
998,,*,"Hey, I'm the one who sent the message to Student Union!",
999,,Iron Fist,"Senpai, anyone could do that job.",
1000,,*,That was mean!,
1001,,Quinie,Will there be many culinary delights waiting for me at the hot spring?,
1002,,Bud Elf,Well… I'm expecting more plants on our way there.,
1003,,Sonya,"If it wasn't for Guan Yin and Joan, I won't join this trip!",
1004,,Sonya,I'd rather spend the time in my cafeteria creating new dishes!,
1005,,Guan Yin,"Look at the bright side, maybe the hot spring will give you some inspiration.",
1006,,Guan Yin,It's just a pity that Joan is not with us. She must be busy.,
1007,,Sonya,She mentioned that she needs to prepare for her Inauguration as the leader of the Discipline Committee.,
1008,,Sonya,"Tch! If I was her, I wouldn't waste my time on that!",
1009,,Psychic,"The disc for Bruno, the nail clipper and pet bath for Rumpy… Uh, I hope I'm not missing anything…",
1010,,Valeera,Good morning~,
1011,,Ithil,"Seems like everyone's ready~ Then, let us---",
1012,,Psychic,Ithil!,
1013,,Ithil,What's wrong?,
1014,,Psychic,Can you wait a bit longer? I forgot to bring Servant Cookies for Rumpy!,
1015,,Ithil,"Rumpy? You mean your cat? Wait, that's Hunter!",
1016,,Rumpy,Meow？,
1017,,Psychic,Huh? Is he bothering you?,
1018,,Ithil,"No… Of course not, just make it quick!",
1019,,Psychic,I will!,
1020,,Turin,It's a… Servant…,
1021,,Ithil,There's still plenty of time and we've got nothing to do. What about…,
1022,,Ithil,"A fight? I mean, some warm-up exercise?",
1023,,*,"Ok... Wait, me? Why me?",
1024,,Ithil,Aren't you the one who skipped my special training?,
1025,,*,Nobody told me I should attend that...,
1026,,Ithil,So? Do you think it's okay to be a couch potato while others are working their butts off training?,
1027,,*,"You got me. You didn't put any place any surveillance camera in my dorm, did you?",
1028,,Aquaris,"What? Senpai, how can you do this! Aren't you supposed to be a good example for all of us?",
1029,,Iron Fist,Can I also join this practice (against Senpai)?,
1030,,Sonya,That's awesome~ May I set a bet for this?,
1031,,Ithil,Have you seen their willpower? Accept your fate~,
1032,,Ithil,Remember to share your snacks with the girls next time!,
1033,,*,Just tell me how do you even know that!,
1034,,Psychic,(Gasp)… I-I'm back… Did I miss something?,
1035,,Psychic,"Senpai, why are you injured?",
1036,,*,"Don't worry, I just miss a step~",
1037,,Psychic,"Ah, you fell? Looks like you did…",
1038,,*,"Yeah, in some specific situations~ Now let's move out!",
1039,,Ithil,"Hehe, you heard him~",
1040,,Students,Hooray!!!,
1041,Through The Forest,Aquaris,Wow~ I like the fresh air here~,
1042,,Iron Fist,It's the smell of these plants~,
1043,,Bud Elf,That's right. It's a plant's paradise~,
1044,,Ithil,"Just follow the direction, and we'll see a river. The destination should be on the other side of that river.",
1045,,Psychic,"If I didn't read the map wrong, shouldn't it be a wasteland?",
1046,,Psychic,"I even checked that before, but I wouldn't dare cross the river.",
1047,,Valeera,"You're right. It's called 「Wasteland of Foehn」. Before that, it was known as 「Redridge Forest」…",
1048,,Valeera,The forest was swept by a forest fire and the fire was stopped by the river.,
1049,,*,Fortunate to have this river if the fire was so catastrophic that it ruined the entire forest…,
1050,,Ithil,And inside the wasteland lies our destination. A great spot for the hot springs~,
1051,,Psychic,Then we'll rely on your help for the rest of the journey.,
1052,,Valeera,Don't worry! That's what we should do~,
1053,,Valeera,"By the way, we've encountered nothing dangerous in this trip yet, that's just---",
1054,,Bud Elf,"Quinie, don't touch that mushroom!!!",
1055,,Quinie,But it looks really good and---,
1056,,Aquaris,Watch out!!,
1057,,Iron Fist,The mushroom explodes…,
1058,,Quinie,Meat… There's meat everywhere…,
1059,,*,Wow! What happened? I know Quinie is crazy for meat but this is just too…,
1060,,Bud Elf,"She is hallucinating! I already warned her, but she just won't listen!",
1061,,Quinie,Meat… Don't leave me… I won't bite…,
1062,,Ithil,"In short, I think we should take her down~",
1063,,Quinie,"W-what happened? Hey! Senpai, why did you pin me to the ground?",
1064,,*,I stopped you from biting others! Are you okay?,
1065,,Quinie,"Uh… I kind of understand what happened, but can you let me go first?",
1066,,Iron Fist,"Obviously, Senpai was feeling great~",
1067,,*,Nonsense… I was only making sure if Quinie was still hallucinating~,
1068,,Ithil,"Alright, let's move on! We got a river to cross!",
1069,Hot Spring,Aquaris,The river is so wide!,
1070,,Valeera,So that's how it could stop the fire~,
1071,,Quinie,Are there any fish in the river?,
1072,,Rumpy,Meow~~,
1073,,Psychic,Rumpy is asking the same question~,
1074,,Bud Elf,Are you really from the Animal Welfare Club…?,
1075,,Psychic,"To survive and persevere, preying on others is one way to be in harmony with nature...",
1076,,Psychic,"As long as it's fulfilling the circle of life, I won't argue with that.",
1077,,Psychic,It's different from hunting.,
1078,,Turin,Animal… Welfare Club?,
1079,,Psychic,I found that club~,
1080,,Psychic,"If you're interested, I can introduce it to you!",
1081,,Ithil,"We'll have plenty of time to talk when we reach our destination. Now, let's cross the river~",
1082,,Iron Fist,"But, isn't the river too wide to swim across?",
1083,,Iron Fist,I don't see any boats or bridges. We don't even have wings…,
1084,,Valeera,Looks like it's time for me to use my elemental magic!,
1085,,Valeera,"I can use wind magic to bring us to the other side, or just simply build a new bridge with earth magic…",
1086,,Valeera,But I prefer to freeze the river. It's the simplest for me!,
1087,,*,It's still beyond my imagination…,
1088,,Guan Yin,Impressive… I never thought a magic spell could be so glorious.,
1089,,Guan Yin,I wonder if I could achieve this with martial art someday…,
1090,,Sonya,"Uh, I don't think that's possible…",
1091,,Valeera,Just compliment me~,
1092,,Valeera,"I picked the spot where the water flow is not so fast, so fewer fish will be harmed~",
1093,,*,"But, it looks more like a wasteland… After we make it across the river…",
1094,,Bud Elf,It's not that desolate. Take a look. There is still some grass growing!,
1095,,Psychic,"However, it's the only plant we can find here…",
1096,,Turin,It's weird…,
1097,,*,What?,
1098,,Turin,It has been a long time since the forest fire. Why is this place still so desolate?,
1099,,Valeera,I'm also in doubt…,
1100,,Valeera,"After the forest fire, the ashes of the burnt plants should supply enough nutrition to grow more plants…",
1101,,Ithil,Rest time is over. Let's keep moving~ The hot spring is just ahead!,
1102,,Rumpy,Meow!,
1103,,Psychic,"Rumpy, wait! He is too excited, why's that?",
1104,,Psychic,"You can get to the hot spring first, I will catch up with you once I find Rumpy.",
1105,,Ithil,"Don't bother, your Rumpy… He's heading towards the right direction.",
1106,,Psychic,???,
1107,,Ithil,(Just as I predicted…),
1108,,*,We're finally here!!!,
1109,,Psychic,The temperature is high and the water is clear. It really is a nice hot spring!,
1110,,Iron Fist,"Ithil is really reliable, she can even find us this nice location~!",
1111,,Sonya,"So, we can enjoy the hot spring now?!",
1112,,Quinie,"The journey is not very tiring, but I still can't wait for it!",
1113,,Aquaris,"Wait! Before that, we have one more issue!",
1114,,*,What's that?,
1115,,Iron Fist,Senpai… Don't pretend to be innocent!,
1116,,*,What do you mean?,
1117,,Aquaris,Are you trying to take the hot spring bath with us?,
1118,,*,Then I....,
1119,,Ithil,"It's impossible to return today, so---",
1120,,Ithil,Why don't you go set up camp first?,
1121,,*,Really?,
1122,,Iron Fist,"If you finish setting it up fast enough, maybe you'll miss out on some scenary~",
1123,,*,Even if you say so…,
1124,,Psychic,So you're really trying to take the hot spring bath with us?,
1125,,Rumpy,Meow!,
1126,,*,Fine…,
1127,A Moment of Rest,*,Why do I suffer? I didn't even get a chance to rest or have a drink.,
1128,,*,And I have to work for free. Better finish this quick~,
1129,,*,"But I have to admit, the place looks pretty strange.",
1130,,*,"There's nothing but grass, and even the grass doesn't look very healthy",
1131,,*,"It is called 「Wasteland of Foehn」…But, what is this Foehn?",
1132,,*,And the forest fire... Was it caused by humans or nature?,
1133,,*,Or even… By an Antique?,
1134,,*,Valeera and Ithil were acting very strange. Being so abruptly enthusiastic about this hot spring trip.,
1135,,*,It's probably not just because they felt guilty about special training. Maybe they have some other plan?,
1136,,*,I need to talk to them about this once I have a chance.,
1137,,Sonya,"Well, Joan should be here and try this out!",
1138,,Guan Yin,It's decided! I'll come back to this place more often!,
1139,,Guan Yin,A hot spring bath after a daily exercise… Nothing could be any better than this.,
1140,,Quinie,"Sonya, have you brought any eggs?",
1141,,Sonya,"No, why?",
1142,,Quinie,"Haha, I heard a dish called Hotspring egg~",
1143,,Guan Yin,Nice idea! Maybe we can bring some eggs with us next time!,
1144,,Bud Elf,This must be how the plants feel when they got watered.,
1145,,Aquaris,It feels so good!!!,
1146,,Iron Fist,This could totally relax my muscles…,
1147,,Aquaris,"Iron Fist, is it okay to leave your prosthetic arm right in the water?",
1148,,Iron Fist,"Yes, it is waterproof, KongMing took that into consideration when she made it~",
1149,,Iron Fist,I just need to clean it up when I have it.,
1150,,Aquaris,"Okay, I understand…",
1151,,Aquaris,By the way…,
1152,,Iron Fist,?,
1153,,Aquaris,Take this!,
1154,,Iron Fist,Hey! Where are you touching…!,
1155,,Aquaris,Wh… Why is it so huge! What do you usually eat!,
1156,,*,Sounds like they're having fun out there… What are they doing exactly?,
1157,,*,"Damn, I really want to join them. Better finish building the camp ASAP!",
1158,Not in Mood,Psychic,"Haha~ Bruno and Rumpy, I'm right here~",
1159,,Bruno,Woof~ Woof~,
1160,,Rumpy,Meow!,
1161,,Psychic,Haha~ Try and catch me~,
1162,,Rumpy,Meow！,
1163,,Bruno,Woof!?,
1164,,Psychic,What!? Since when did you learn how to be so cooperative?,
1165,,Psychic,"No… Looking at Bruno's reaction, Rumpy used him as a drawing board…",
1166,,Psychic,"Alright, that's enough. Now come and rest~",
1167,,Bruno,Woof~,
1168,,Rumpy,Meow,
1169,,Psychic,"By the way, don't leave us alone again, Rumpy.",
1170,,Psychic,"Luckily, you went the right direction. Otherwise, I would've wasted more time trying to find you.",
1171,,Rumpy,Meow…,
1172,,Psychic,But why did you leave alone?,
1173,,Psychic,Did you sense the hot spring in advance?,
1174,,Psychic,"Hold on, is that---?",
1175,,,Turin kept wandering around alone along the edge of the hot spring.,
1176,,,As if there's an invisible wall separating her and the girls that are enjoying themselves…,
1177,,Psychic,"Turin, why aren't you bathing in the hot spring?",
1178,,Turin,Oh… I…,
1179,,Psychic,Or you want to join us?,
1180,,Bruno,Woof~,
1181,,Psychic,Bruno likes you~,
1182,,Turin,……,
1183,,Psychic,"Senpai is building a camp, and we don't know when he will finish it.",
1184,,Psychic,And Ithil and Valeera are on patrol. Are you still worried if Senpai will peep on us?,
1185,,Psychic,"I got it... You must feel alone since nobody you know is around, right?",
1186,,Turin,.....,
1187,,Psychic,"Don't worry, come hang out~ Bruno and Rumpy want to be friends with you~",
1188,,Turin,Rumpy…,
1189,Confirmation,,When the girls are having fun…,
1190,,Valeera,(sigh)…,
1191,,Ithil,.....,
1192,,Valeera,(sigh)………,
1193,,Ithil,What's going on?,
1194,,Valeera,Don't I look pathetic? The others are taking a hot spring bath and I'm here working with you...T_T,
1195,,Ithil,I can do it myself.,
1196,,Valeera,"I'm just saying, but I won't leave you alone! Just let me mourn a little for the happy hour I missed~",
1197,,Ithil,I think you will be excited very soon.,
1198,,Valeera,Why?,
1199,,Ithil,Look over there---,
1200,,,"That's a piece of fresco, and time has left its marks on it.",
1201,,Valeera,OK… Seems like it records some kind of ritual. Does it look like a shining Crystal?,
1202,,Valeera,"And, the participants are not only Hunters…",
1203,,Ithil,There is a silhouette of a human. He could even be the host of this ritual.,
1204,,Valeera,The pack of Hunters? Sounds mysterious.,
1205,,Valeera,I thought they were almost extinct because of the fire and the war against Chaos.,
1206,,Ithil,I thought so too... Until I saw a Hunter named Rumpy.,
1207,,Valeera,And there are still marks that show their habitat…,
1208,,Valeera,"They might just still be alive, but they cannot leave here for some kind of reason. Which means…",
1209,,Ithil,You might have guessed correctly.,
1210,,Valeera,Now I'm getting excited!,
1211,,Ithil,But it's also time for us to go back.,
1212,,Valeera,Fair enough. There's no more information left.,
1213,,Valeera,But it's enough for us to get to the next stage of our operation…,
1214,,Ithil,I thought you would be dismayed to get such little information.,
1215,,Valeera,There's nothing that could excite me more than proving that I was right!,
1216,,Ithil,"Whatever you say~ Now, please follow me to the hot spring, great scholar~",
1217,The Real Purpose,,The hot spring became peaceful after the girls bathing.,
1218,,,They're now heading back to the camp for their dinner.,
1219,,,"Now, there's only one left.",
1220,,*,I knew it will be too late to see some beautiful scenery no matter how hard I work~,
1221,,*,"But it's okay, it's still comforting to have a hot spring bath after hard-work~",
1222,,？？？,Yo~ Nice body!!!,
1223,,*,Who's that?,
1224,,Valeera,"It's me, Valeera of course!",
1225,,*,Valeera and Ithil? Why are you here…,
1226,,Ithil,We went on a patrol.,
1227,,*,…Were you suspecting me of peeping on others?,
1228,,Valeera,That is something you thought up when you let your imaginations run wild!,
1229,,Ithil,"Cut the crap, Valeera. Just tell him what we found.",
1230,,*,???,
1231,,Ithil,"Actually, we two have some other tasks to do besides letting the girls have a rest from the hard training.",
1232,,*,I knew that…,
1233,,Valeera,"According to the file from my Grand Library, I found something.",
1234,,Valeera,There is something very useful for us in this place.,
1235,,Ithil,"According to the marks we found in the cave nearby, we found there was a civilization that existed a long time ago.",
1236,,*,"But, didn't the forest fire destroyed that?",
1237,,Valeera,"Obviously, it didn't.",
1238,,Valeera,Those from that civilization might just be hiding somewhere out here.,
1239,,*,So… The civilization must be linked to the 「Antique」 you're trying to find?,
1240,,Valeera,"Correct. But before I explain further, I think it's necessary to teach you a lesson.",
1241,,*,What? Why?,
1242,,Valeera,To keep your mouth shut~,
1243,,*,I promised I won't tell others about your secret--,
1244,Lonely Girl,Ithil,We'll talk about the Antique later when we return to the Academy.,
1245,,*,Final question： The civilization you mentioned. Are the people in it friendly?,
1246,,Valeera,.....,
1247,,Ithil,…I'd just want to say don't be so hopeful about it.,
1248,,Ithil,"Now, you should leave.",
1249,,*,???,
1250,,Ithil,It's about time for us to enjoy the hot spring.,
1251,,Valeera,"But if you want to join us, we won't say no! (clenches fist)",
1252,,*,...Good bye.,
1253,,*,……,
1254,,*,…………,
1255,,*,Wait! Did I miss anything???,
1256,,*,Noooo!!! I haven't bathed yet!!!,
1257,,*,Huh? Is that…,
1258,,,"The camp is lively, and most of the girls are happy. But near the campfire, there's still one person who failed to get her share of happiness.",
1259,,*,Turin?,
1260,,Psychic,"Senpai, have you noticed that? Turin has been acting strange.",
1261,,*,Do you know the reason?,
1262,,Psychic,"No, but she's been like this since we had a hot spring bath in the afternoon.",
1263,,Psychic,"We tried to make her happy. She did smile, but I still think she's a little bit…",
1264,,*,"Well, if we want to know what happened, just ask! Maybe she looks forward to us taking care of her~",
1265,,Psychic,Directly helping her? That's Senpai's style~,
1266,Turin's Game,Turin,.....,
1267,,*,Turin~,
1268,,Turin,Senpai…,
1269,,Psychic,I brought him here~,
1270,,Turin,Psychic…,
1271,,Rumpy,Meow~~,
1272,,Bruno,Woof!,
1273,,Psychic,I brought Rumpy and Bruno too~,
1274,,Turin,...,
1275,,*,You look worried. Anything I can do to help?,
1276,,Turin,It's just…,
1277,,*,"If that's your secret, you don't have to tell us.",
1278,,*,"But if it's some problem you've encountered, don't try to do it alone. We got your back~",
1279,,Turin,It's not a secret… It's just guilt…,
1280,,*,Guilt?,
1281,,Turin,"Senpai and Psychic, have you ever heard 「Turin's Game」?",
1282,,Psychic,"I have no idea… But you stared at Rumpy when you talk about this, is that a game for servants?",
1283,,Turin,It's not a game. It's a nightmare for servants…,
1284,,,Turin took out a fist-sized spherical device.,
1285,,Turin,This is the servant control system Sivney and I developed.,
1286,,*,Sivney? Servant control system? Did you use that to control the servants?,
1287,,Turin,"I have. During the war against Chaos, I used it to control a great number of servants.",
1288,,Turin,"And the servants I controlled helped us defeated the Legion of Chaos, but…",
1289,,Psychic,Most of them died during the war…,
1290,,Turin,"This might be an excuse. But at that time, I had no other choice…",
1291,,Turin,So I have to gather everything I can to defeat the Chaos…,
1292,,*,But why 「Turin's Game」 has never been heard from again?,
1293,,Turin,Most of the servants equipped with my device were eliminated along with Regiment 「Omega」 during an ambush by the Legion.,
1294,,Turin,I was also seriously wounded in the ambush and lost control of the system…,
1295,,Turin,I must had brought them great harm…,
1296,Emotion,Turin,"When I first received my own emotion, I was very happy.",
1297,,Turin,"But after having seeing Rumpy, my heart has been tortured by the guilt over what I did over and over.",
1298,,Turin,"Those actions I once took for granted, even if I still know they are all done for the Academy.",
1299,,Turin,"I still feel guilty, so guilty that it's spreading through my entire body…",
1300,,Turin,Why does this emotion make me feel so bad?,
1301,,*,Turin...,
1302,,Psychic,I cannot understand that very well but…,
1303,,Psychic,"Turin, as I told you, I found a club.",
1304,,Turin,The Animal Welfare Club…,
1305,,Psychic,"Ever since I entered the campus, I found many homeless animals…",
1306,,Psychic,"They might have different powers or different personalities, but they all share the same kind of loneliness and helplessness.",
1307,,Psychic,My heart was almost broken when I first saw them.,
1308,,Turin,.....,
1309,,Psychic,And this is the reason I found the Animal Welfare Club.,
1310,,Psychic,The emotion is a kind of like a standard in conduct. It will urge you to do the right thing when it signals something bad will happen.,
1311,,Psychic,"So when you start feeling guilty, it's about time for you to make a difference.",
1312,,Turin,But… What can I do?,
1313,,Psychic,What about taking your first step by joining our club?,
1314,,Psychic,We can further research the servants and improve their standard of living.,
1315,,Psychic,"So that someday, the servants might be able to go back to where they originally belong to.",
1316,,Turin,But… I… I don't feel qualified…,
1317,,Psychic,What you did doesn't matter! But what you want to do now does!,
1318,,Psychic,I think that guilt of yours will turn into determination to protect the servants! Can you do this?,
1319,,Turin,C-Can I do that?,
1320,,Rumpy,Meow~~,
1321,,Bruno,Woof!!,
1322,,Psychic,"See, Rumpy and Bruno gave their answer!",
1323,,Turin,I...,
1324,,Turin,"The enemies are approaching, Hunter squad, engage.",
1325,,Hunters,Meow………,
1326,,Turin,More time is required for the other regiments to complete their mission.,
1327,,Turin,Activating 「Turin's Game」.,
1328,,Turin,"Hunter squad, engage.",
1329,,Hunters,Meow……… (Roar)!!!,
1330,,Rumpy,Meow？,
1331,,Turin,So… That's what the emotion is trying to show me…,
1332,Shadows from the Past,Psychic,"So, will you join us, Turin?",
1333,,Turin,Yes… But before that…,
1334,,Psychic,?,
1335,,Turin,"Psychic, can you stop treating me like I'm one of your pets…? It's embarrassing…",
1336,,Psychic,"Sorry, I got used to it, but it feels so good… Haha",
1337,,Turin,Now… I've made up my mind. I will join your club.,
1338,,Turin,And 「Turin's Game」… I will destroy it to bits.,
1339,,*,Wait!,
1340,,Turin,"Why? If I don't destroy it, someone bad might steal it…",
1341,,*,I've got one more thing to figure out…,
1342,,*,"Turin, did you mention Sivney?",
1343,,Turin,Yes… She's the technical squad leader of Regiment 「Omega」… But I don't know where she is now…,
1344,,Turin,"You might think she's weird, but her ability was reliable.",
1345,,Turin,"Though we developed the system together, she completed the main part.",
1346,,Turin,So I have no idea how it works…,
1347,,*,I understand. Then there's one more reason for us to not destroy 「Turin's game」,
1348,,Turin,???,
1349,,*,"「Turin's game」may have harmed the servants, but we can use its technology to benefit them.",
1350,,*,Just like the anesthetic designed by Raphael. It could be used either for surgery or a lethal weapon…,
1351,,Psychic,"(If this is heard by Raphael, Senpai will surely become the test sample to see if it's lethal or not…)",
1352,,*,The only person who wields its power can decide if the power becomes good or evil.,
1353,,*,"And if we can find out how the device works, we will be able to put it to good use.",
1354,,*,"Besides, now Turin can use it properly.",
1355,,Turin,"I can understand that. But, I don't want to use this power any longer…",
1356,,*,Then let me keep it for now. Will you trust me?,
1357,,Turin,Of course! I could not think of any better place to keep it.,
1358,,Psychic,"Alright, it's dark already. Let's get back to camp and rest.",
1359,,Psychic,"Stay sharp for tomorrow, you know~",
1360,,,I could finally calm my nerves after seeing Turin and Psychic returning.,
1361,,*,(Sivney… Is she still alive?),
1362,,*,(Will she bring hope to us just like Ithil and Valeera did…,
1363,,*,(Or bring ruin and destruction like Kratos?),
1364,,*,"(Whatever the case is, I must keep the campus safe…)",
1365,Foehn!!!,Aquaris,Yo!!,
1366,,Iron Fist,"Good morning, everyone~",
1367,,Bud Elf,I won't sleep with Quinie again! I found her dragging my leg when I woke up!,
1368,,Bud Elf,I thought she really wants to eat me!,
1369,,Quinie,"Haha, it's all your fault, you smell way too good for me~",
1370,,Guan Yin,Happy time is over~,
1371,,Sonya,Maybe we can come back again later~,
1372,,Psychic,It's really nice to make new friends during this trip~,
1373,,Turin,Psychic~,
1374,,Rumpy,Meow~,
1375,,Bruno,Woof!,
1376,,*,Seems like everyone was happy with this trip~,
1377,,*,(But I didn't dip into any hot spring… I found more trouble instead),
1378,,Ithil,It's good to know that~,
1379,,Ithil,"Alright everyone, let's pack up our luggage. We're going home~",
1380,,*,"By the way, why is this place called Wasteland of Foehn?",
1381,,Iron Fist,"Yeah, I also want to know… 「Foehn」 sounds dangerous.",
1382,,Iron Fist,Is that related to the forest fire?,
1383,,Valeera,"Ithil learned about its name during her trip, but we're not exactly clear about it.",
1384,,Valeera,All we know is that there's a volcano nearby…,
1385,,*,Understandable… That explains why there is a hot spring.,
1386,,*,But if anything from the volcano slides down and heats the air nearby…,
1387,,*,It can really create some foehn-like effects.,
1388,,Iron Fist,Really…? That sounds terrifying.,
1389,,Valeera,But volcanos don't often erupt.,
1390,,Valeera,It doesn't happen often enough to be called that name…,
1391,,Ithil,Everyone move! It's coming!,
1392,,*,What's coming?,
1393,,Valeera,It can't be a Foehn?,
1394,,Ithil,Actually it is.,
1395,,Valeera,Ah crap…! I won't say such nonsense again!,
1396,,*,"I got it! The regular eruption of the volcano caused multiple foehn winds, so…",
1397,,Iron Fist,"Now isn't the best time to think about this, Senpai! Prepare for impact!",
1398,,Valeera,"Hold on, the barrier spell will be ready soon---",
1399,,Iron Fist,The temperature is rising!!!,
1400,,*,It burns when I speak…,
1401,,*,(Gasp)… It's finally over…,
1402,,Aquaris,"Senpai, if your tongue hurts, don't bother to speak~",
1403,,*,"No wollies, ich justsa scrach…",
1404,,Aquaris,What did he say?,
1405,,Turin,"「No worries, it's just a scratch.」",
1406,,Iron Fist,But the foehn wind is truly a disaster… It's just blazing winds burning through.,
1407,,Iron Fist,And that's why this forest hasn't been recovering…,
1408,,Ithil,"Alright, break is over, we need to keep moving.",
1409,,Valeera,"Yes, the volcano's eruption was random. We cannot risk---",
1410,,Psychic,"Valeera, please don't say anything anymore…",
1411,,Valeera,My bad…,
1412,,Rumpy,Meow！！,
1413,,Ithil,Are my senses working?,
1414,,Ithil,I felt someone was watching us…,
1415,,？？？,……,
1416,The Antique Plan,*,Why am I the only one who has to come with you to the Grand Library? I want to go back to my dorm!,
1417,,Ithil,We didn't force you to eavesdrop on our conversation~,
1418,,*,"I didn't mean to do so, plus, I only heard a few words!",
1419,,Valeera,So you did eavesdrop?,
1420,,*,………Is that all you want me to say!?!?,
1421,,Ithil,"That was a joke. Now, let's get down to business.",
1422,,Ithil,I believe Mr. Supervisor has noticed. Yume Academy is weaker than ever before.,
1423,,*,……,
1424,,Ithil,"""Li"" is absent, Seal is dead, and several Valkyries have lost their power.",
1425,,Ithil,The campus is almost unguarded now.,
1426,,*,How did I not notice that…,
1427,,Valeera,"When I was archiving the files, I learned something about the Antique.",
1428,,Valeera,"It's like the physical form of some kind of phenomenon, and it's inseparably linked with the operation of our world…",
1429,,*,It sounds like a powerful weapon… Are you planning to use it to defend Yume Academy?,
1430,,Ithil,Correct. We will be able to use the Antique's power once we acquire it.,
1431,,Ithil,"Furthermore, we can even bring ""Li"" back.",
1432,,*,So you thought you can find some clues near the hot spring?,
1433,,Valeera,"And we did. I found a record of a legend, but I don't know who was the author...",
1434,,Valeera,The legend records something about 「Redridge Forest」.,
1435,,,"With the power of fire and hunt on thy hand, the God of Lynx descends from the north.",
1436,,,He sets the leaves on fire and silences the woods.,
1437,,,"But even in the coldest nights of winter, the flame of our God stands with us.",
1438,,,"Place our sacrifice in front of the eye of our God, and his warm tears will aid us in surviving the winter.",
1439,,Valeera,What do you think that implies?,
1440,,*,It sounds like it's explaining some kind of natural phenomena.,
1441,,*,The leaves setting on fire might be describing the maple leaves turning red.,
1442,,*,"And the warm tears could be the hot springs, but…",
1443,,Valeera,The eye of their God is described in detail…,
1444,,Valeera,There's even a description of the habitats strengthening themselves with its flame.,
1445,,*,So that is the Antique…?,
1446,,Ithil,"But according to that, the time of the record...",
1447,,Ithil,It should be before the forest becomes a wasteland.,
1448,,Ithil,So we think it's necessary to confirm that.,
1449,,*,And the tribe in the legend…?,
1450,,Ithil,It's the tribe of Hunters… We had some… help from them during the last war…,
1451,,*,That makes sense…,
1452,,Valeera,Huh? So you already knew that?,
1453,,*,(The tribe that was hurt by 「Turin's Game」… How could I not know…),
1454,,*,"And, about how the forest was silenced… Is that implying the forest fire?",
1455,,Valeera,It's hard to tell… But I believe the forest fire could be more of an accident.,
1456,,Valeera,Maybe it's caused by the invasion of Chaos,
1457,,Ithil,A tribe that worships flame got destroyed by what they're worshipping. That's ironic.,
1458,,*,I got it… But… Why don't you just tell everyone?,
1459,,*,If there's any danger…,
1460,,Ithil,Because we cannot leak that to D.E.F.,
1461,,*,"D.E.F? After Seal was defeated, D.E.F should be…",
1462,,Ithil,I spent some time learning what happened on campus during my absence.,
1463,,Ithil,"From my point of view, what D.E.F did was to go against ""Li"".",
1464,,Ithil,"And what ""Li"" did wasn't exactly… Friendly.",
1465,,Ithil,"So, I think it's necessary to keep D.E.F away from this and maintain the peace on campus.",
1466,,Ithil,"And if D.E.F knows about Antique, they would be many steps ahead of us.",
1467,,*,That's why we're taking them on a trip to the hot spring as an excuse…,
1468,,*,By the way… Is this the same reason you sent Saint out on a mission?,
1469,,Ithil,"I do hope Saint won't go against us, so I sent her out on a task as a test.",
1470,,Ithil,"As the campus is still in danger, we cannot bear to have any infighting.",
1471,,Valeera,Ithil cares about the safety of the students more than anyone!,
1472,,Valeera,"Of course, except you~",
1473,,*,"Yeah, I already known that.",
1474,,Ithil,"In short, this is all that we got.",
1475,,Ithil,Are you in?,
1476,,*,Join what?,
1477,,Ithil,"I hope you can join our team as the captain to search for the Antique, Mr. Supervisor~",
1478,Hesitation,,"Evening of October 20th, 129th year of the new Calendar, in Grand Library Ulbricht",
1479,,*,Ahhh... I should have noticed that. Now I'm in trouble again...,
1480,,Valeera,Isn't that the duty of a Senpai to join our course?,
1481,,*,"Not with so little notice... After all what we've seen during the last trip, I'm still shaken...",
1482,,*,I didn't even enjoy the hot spring...,
1483,,Ithil,"Then it's your lucky day. According to the itinerary, we will pass by the hot spring.",
1484,,*,Really? You girls are so kind... You think I would say something like that? Are you planning on causing trouble?,
1485,,Ithil,It doesn't matter. What matters is your answer.,
1486,,*,……,
1487,,*,It's not the best time.,
1488,,Ithil,"...Fair enough, I understand. I need your answer in 3 days.",
1489,,*,Only 3 days...?,
1490,,Ithil,"On the evening of the 3rd day, I'll be waiting for you at the forest near the gate.",
1491,,Ithil,"If I don't see you before 12 P.M., I'll assume you have declined our offer.",
1492,,*,Uh... Will there be any consequences...?,
1493,,Ithil,"No worries! We can still have fun, with or without you.",
1494,,Valeera,But it won't be the same without Senpai~,
1495,,*,(That's an exaggeration...),
1496,,Ithil,I'll let Turin know later. We'll need more who we can trust to join us.,
1497,,Ithil,"Besides being strong, we'd want our teammates to be willing to sacrifice for the greater good...",
1498,,Ithil,"If you know anyone else that fits our requirements, bring them with you. I don't think it will be hard for you to find girls to answer your call.",
1499,,*,"I can do that, but I can think of only a few qualified for this...",
1500,,*,D.E.F is also an unstable factor.,
1501,,Ithil,I'm sure you can convince Iron Fist.,
1502,,Ithil,"She trusts you, and her training results are also satisfactory.",
1503,,*,Iron Fist... I don't think so.,
1504,,*,Her physical condition is not that good as you think. KongMing and Raphael have told me so.,
1505,,Ithil,...I see. Then it's up to you.,
1506,,Ithil,"But remember, you have 3 days to make your choice. You cannot change your decision.",
1507,,*,Okay... I will think over.,
1508,,Valeera,I don't know if he's going to join us.,
1509,,Ithil,"Me neither. As ex-Supervisors, he and Turin would be very beneficial to our team.",
1510,,Valeera,Maybe we should just force him to come with us?,
1511,,Ithil,That's off the table.,
1512,,Valeera,"Wow, you are too nice of a leader~",
1513,,Ithil,……,
1514,,Valeera,"Hey! Quit staring at me! You creep me out, even with your eye mask on...",
1515,Chaos Spreading,*,Uh... A trip to search for the antique... It must be a long journey...,
1516,,*,We don't even know what we're walking into... Maybe it will be dangerous... Even for Ithil.,
1517,,Joan,Chaos creature detected. Prepare for battle!,
1518,,*,"What? Is that, Joan? She's commanding the Discipline Committee...",
1519,,Joan,Lure them to the designated location and surround them!,
1520,,*,Seems they don't need my help...,
1521,,*,"Wait, the Chaos creatures are already spawning on campus now?",
1522,,Joan,...! Why is Senpai here? Initiate plan B!,
1523,,*,Uh... Am I blocking their way? And why is the Chaos creatures charging at me…?,
1524,,*,Seems I have to fight my way through this!,
1525,,Joan,"Senpai, it's dangerous to wander around by yourself.",
1526,,Joan,"Some Chaos creatures spawned on campus recently, so we made a quarantine zone here.",
1527,,*,Oh... I didn't know that.,
1528,,Joan,... Then consider that my fault for not letting everyone know this.,
1529,,Joan,"By the way, why do you look so lost?",
1530,,*,"...Don't worry, it's just something personal.",
1531,,Joan,I see~ I just wonder what can make you look so worried after a trip.,
1532,,Joan,"Did something happen, Senpai?",
1533,,*,Uh... What have you heard?,
1534,,Joan,I heard that you encountered some kind of hot wind…,
1535,,Joan,"Never mind, it's good to see you in one piece.",
1536,,*,(…How do they already know?),
1537,,*,"Yeah, that was close. We might not able to make it back without Valeera's magic.",
1538,,Joan,I understand... It's the last thing one would expect from such a trip.,
1539,,*,"It wasn't that bad. Besides, your experience must be worse than mine. Guan Yin and Sonya told us about how much they want you to come with us.",
1540,,Joan,"If I had any other choice, I would be happy to join you.",
1541,,Joan,It's just not the best time. And with those Chaos creatures threatening the campus...,
1542,,Joan,"They can hardly be considered a threat now, but I think it's necessary to find out the reason for their arrival.",
1543,,*,(Things can go south so quickly...),
1544,,Joan,Do you have any ideas? I can hardly think of a reason for you to start thinking again.,
1545,,*,H-how can it be? I'm still confused.,
1546,,Joan,Seriously? Your behavior says otherwise.,
1547,,Joan,"But whatever, it is our job to figure out what's happening.",
1548,,*,"Before I forget, congratulations for being promoted to the Chairman of Discipline Committee!",
1549,,Joan,I just take this position temporarily... Consider me an adjunct.,
1550,,Joan,I'm will step down once Michael recovers.,
1551,,*,I thought it was your ambition to sit on the highest table.,
1552,,Joan,I ain't like Saint or Gambler.,
1553,,Joan,I only do what needs to be done.,
1554,,Athena,Report! This area is secured!,
1555,,Athena,We need to start patrolling the playground now.,
1556,,Joan,"Copy that, I'll catch up with you later.",
1557,,Athena,Roger. We're moving out.,
1558,,*,Seems the patrols have become more regular.,
1559,,Joan,"We don't have a choice. For the safety of other students, we might even impose a curfew in the future...",
1560,,*,That sounds horrible...,
1561,,Joan,"Alright, it's about time for me to get back to work.",
1562,,Joan,"By the way, I'm supposed to inform you that KongMing wants to see you in her office tomorrow.",
1563,,*,Me?,
1564,,Joan,She seemed very angry when she told me. It's not easy for her to get angry.,
1565,,*,I don't know...,
1566,,Joan,I shall continue the patrol. Good luck with that~,
1567,,*,"Wait, at least tell me what KongMing wants me for!",
1568,,*,She's gone...,
1569,,*,Why does KongMing want to see me... Hope she won't kill me...,
1570,Hidden Threats,,The next day,
1571,,*,……,
1572,,KongMing,……,
1573,,*,(I don't like this feeling...),
1574,,*,(Maybe I should break the silence...?),
1575,,*,"Uh, well...",
1576,,KongMing,Senpai.,
1577,,*,"Gaahhh!! Oh... Yes, I'm listening.",
1578,,KongMing,Do you remember the reason I approved this trip?,
1579,,*,To... Help the students relax?,
1580,,KongMing,Yes... That's the only reason.,
1581,,KongMing,"And a trip like this, it's supposed to be a SAFE trip, right?",
1582,,*,"Couldn't have put it better myself, Ma'am.",
1583,,KongMing,Then tell me why... You try to go after Foehn and put everyone else in danger?,
1584,,*,Huh…?,
1585,,KongMing,"I understand Ithil and you are planning for something else,",
1586,,KongMing,"which includes using this trip to cover up your trails. However, the students' safety should always be the first priority...",
1587,,KongMing,Ithil must have foreseen the danger you would meet during the trip.,
1588,,KongMing,"If she still took the risk, then it must be something important.",
1589,,*,(She got almost everything right...),
1590,,KongMing,So... What was it?,
1591,,*,"(I have to at least give her something, or she won't let me go easily)",
1592,,,"So I tell her what we found in the cave but didn't mention the part with ""Li"" involved.",
1593,,,And I described the Antique just as some tool with great power.,
1594,,,"In general, I wasn't telling a lie...",
1595,,KongMing,I see.,
1596,,KongMing,So Ithil wants to find this Antique thing to protect the Academy?,
1597,,*,That's right... They didn't tell me their plan until they already carried it out.,
1598,,KongMing,"Well, that makes sense.",
1599,,*,Maybe you also want to know...,
1600,,KongMing,"Stop, I know what you're going to say.",
1601,,KongMing,Just give me a break. You're giving me a lot of trouble.,
1602,,*,………………,
1603,,KongMing,…………,
1604,,*,……,
1605,,KongMing,"Okay. I believe Ithil wants to assemble a team to search for that Antique, right?",
1606,,*,"Yes, that's right.",
1607,,KongMing,"If that Antique can solve the Chaos creature problem on campus these days,",
1608,,KongMing,maybe it's worth a shot...,
1609,,*,So..?,
1610,,KongMing,"Unfortunately, the Student Union cannot provide you any help in this.",
1611,,KongMing,"Because of the problem caused by the Chaos creatures, we cannot spare anyone.",
1612,,KongMing,"We can handle them easily now, but we don't know how strong they will become in the near future.",
1613,,*,I've noticed that. Even the chairman of Discipline Committee has joined the patrol.,
1614,,KongMing,The existence of D.E.F is my second reason.,
1615,,KongMing,I believe it's also the reason Ithil used the trip as a cover to do her job.,
1616,,KongMing,"It's true that Saint is out on a mission and Lucifer has lost her memory, but we can still detect some D.E.F movements.",
1617,,KongMing,"Currently we have no idea what they want to do, but I believe it necessary to keep an eye on them.",
1618,,*,Even when we need to unite all our forces.,
1619,,KongMing,"In conclusion, while I can understand the importance to get that Antique. I am not able to help you.",
1620,,*,I understand that... I'm thankful for your understanding.,
1621,,KongMing,"But you're going to go through with it anyway, ain't you?",
1622,,*,"Yes. I'm your Senpai, after all.",
1623,,KongMing,"Then, I think it's necessary to let you know…",
1624,,*,What?,
1625,,KongMing,If you're looking for anyone to join you...,
1626,,KongMing,Don't ask Iron Fist.,
1627,,*,Just to make sure...,
1628,,*,"She's not just over-exhausted, right?",
1629,,KongMing,Since you will eventually figure it out...,
1630,,KongMing,I should just tell you right now.,
1631,,KongMing,"Inside her, there's...",
1632,,*,！？,
1633,Decision,*,……,
1634,,*,……,
1635,,*,(Damn... How could this happen...),
1636,,*,(Iron Fist...),
1637,,？？？,Yoohoo~ Senpai!,
1638,,？？？,Huh... A-Aquaris...!?,
1639,,*,Ouch!,
1640,,,It was just like Aquaris made a slam dunk and my back was her basketball hoop...,
1641,,*,"(Cough) Don't do that again, it hurts! I thought the Chaos attacked us again",
1642,,Aquaris,It's not nice to treat your cute friend like a Chaos creature!,
1643,,*,"Yeah yeah, you might just be something worse than that.",
1644,,Iron Fist,"... Senpai, are you okay?",
1645,,*,I'd be better if you had stopped her...,
1646,,Iron Fist,I tried... But she's too fast...,
1647,,*,Why are you here?,
1648,,Aquaris,"Senpai, did you remember I'm a now Discipline Member?",
1649,,Aquaris,I'm here for campus security.,
1650,,*,Unlikely...,
1651,,Aquaris,We could only train with the seniors in the past.,
1652,,Aquaris,"But thanks to the Chaos creatures, I can now play --- I mean patrol freely.",
1653,,Iron Fist,So why am I here again?,
1654,,Aquaris,Is there something wrong? It's more fun than training!,
1655,,Iron Fist,Well... It doesn't feel so bad...,
1656,,Aquaris,You can say when you feel happy. Don't always try to hide your emotions.,
1657,,Iron Fist,I wasn't hiding anything...,
1658,,*,（……）,
1659,,*,(A team to search for the Antique... Should I invite them?),
1660,,*,(It could be more dangerous than I've predicted...),
1661,,*,(They don't deserve that kind of encounter...),
1662,,*,(I cannot do that...),
1663,,Iron Fist,"...? Senpai, are you okay?",
1664,,*,Oh... I'm alright.,
1665,,Aquaris,Senpai! You're ruining my moment!,
1666,,Aquaris,"Here, turn your frown upside down and let's go play... I mean patrol!",
1667,,Joan,Aquaris! What are you doing here?! You have a patrol mission! Get back in line!,
1668,,Aquaris,Crap... They noticed me... Let's run!,
1669,,*,Why do you always skip everything...,
1670,,Iron Fist,Why am I running away with you…?,
1671,,*,(... That's fine),
1672,,*,(You just need to stay in a safe place),
1673,,*,(The dangers should be mine to deal with!),
1674,Determination,,"Another 2 days later, midnight, Yume Forest",
1675,,,"After Discipline Committee imposed a curfew, there are only a few Committee Members whose patrol missions can be seen at the moment.",
1676,,,…Someone just sneaked out from  their supervision and got into the forest outside the Academy.,
1677,,Valeera,Awww... It's already pretty late. Is Senpai really not coming?,
1678,,Ithil,...It doesn't matter. Let's go.,
1679,,Turin,Wait... Someone's coming... It's Senpai! But...,
1680,,Valeera,He's alone?,
1681,,Ithil,Fool...,
1682,,*,"Hi, sorry for keeping you waiting~",
1683,,Valeera,"The ""Hi"" part was really stupid!",
1684,,Valeera,"Senpai, did you forgot to bring any allies?",
1685,,*,Well... I thought long about this...,
1686,,*,But I concluded that... The trip will be too dangerous.,
1687,,*,And I have no reason to put them in danger.,
1688,,Valeera,"??? Senpai, you're just digging your own grave!",
1689,,*,Sorry for that... I will do my best to help you myself.,
1690,,Turin,At least you're here. That's good enough for us.,
1691,,Ithil,"Looks like this is all we got. Then let's move out... Wait, someone else are coming.",
1692,,,2 figures approach,
1693,,,My worst fears have come true. They're here.,
1694,,Aquaris,Yoohoo~ Senpai!,
1695,,Iron Fist,"Shh! Lower your voice, Aquaris~! The patrol team is still nearby!",
1696,,*,You two are not supposed to be here... How did you find me?,
1697,,Iron Fist,"Well... You looked so worried these days, Senpai.",
1698,,Iron Fist,"I thought you were hiding something, so I followed you to find out your secret...",
1699,,Aquaris,Then we found you trying to sneak out of the Academy...,
1700,,Aquaris,"Since we imposed a curfew, your behavior is forbidden!",
1701,,*,You're doing the same thing...,
1702,,*,Isn't there a double standard going on here?,
1703,,Iron Fist,"Don't try to distract us, Senpai...",
1704,,Iron Fist,You must be leaving the Academy with Ithil for something important. Please let me join you!,
1705,,Ithil,Having two additional teammates would be great.,
1706,,Ithil,"Senpai, I think you should make the decision here.",
1707,,*,"...Iron Fist, come with me.",
1708,,Iron Fist,……,
1709,,*,(This is awkward),
1710,,*,(Should I tell her the truth...?),
1711,,*,"Uh... Iron Fist, you need to know, this trip is full of danger.",
1712,,*,You are very tired recently. Perhaps it's best if you sit this one out.,
1713,,Iron Fist,No.,
1714,,*,Iron Fist...,
1715,,Iron Fist,I understand that you're worried about my physical condition.,
1716,,*,Yes. And I believe you can understand...,
1717,,Iron Fist,Don't worry about me then. I feel okay after resting the last few days.,
1718,,Iron Fist,My prosthetic arm is also stable. I won't let you down.,
1719,,*,You don't know what I mean...,
1720,,Iron Fist,"Senpai, if you're talking about the issue of my body... I already know.",
1721,,*,What?,
1722,,Iron Fist,I've already noticed that you and KongMing are hiding something from me.,
1723,,Iron Fist,I'm the only one who lost an arm before coming on campus.,
1724,,Iron Fist,"My body can still feel the pain, even when my prosthetic arm is equipped.",
1725,,Iron Fist,"If I'm not mistaken, maybe inside my body...",
1726,,*,Enough about this subject!,
1727,,Iron Fist,"Senpai, I want to figure out what happened to my body.",
1728,,Iron Fist,What happened to me before I entered the Academy.,
1729,,*,...I don't know the details. Maybe even KongMing doesn't know.,
1730,,Iron Fist,That's one more reason for me to join you. I cannot find out what I need to know by staying on campus.,
1731,,Iron Fist,If the situation is as bad as I predicted... I do not have much time left...!,
1732,,Iron Fist,I need to know the truth!,
1733,,*,But...,
1734,,Iron Fist,I'm no longer someone who always needs your protection.,
1735,,Iron Fist,We've gone through many tough times.,
1736,,Iron Fist,Let me help you!,
1737,,*,Iron Fist...,
1738,,*,……,
1739,,*,You've changed a lot.,
1740,,Iron Fist,"Yes, I have.",
1741,,,I can see the determination from her eyes.,
1742,,,It looks like she has already made up her mind.,
1743,,,Any rejection from me will do more harm than good.,
1744,,*,Well... Looks like you've earned your chance.,
1745,,*,But please don't be too hard on yourself.,
1746,,Iron Fist,...I will!,
1747,,,"...At this moment, I don't know if I will regret this decision.",
1748,Worst Teammate,,"After I returned to Ithil with Iron Fist, I noticed there's still someone who's not supposed to be here.",
1749,,,Someone who doesn't seem to have a reason to be here.,
1750,,*,So... Why are you here?,
1751,,Aquaris,Huh? Me?,
1752,,Aquaris,The reason is simple. You know... Every girl might have a dream...,
1753,,Aquaris,To have a dangerous adventure with friends... To have a romantic encounter with her Prince Charming...,
1754,,Aquaris,Or to get myself into serious trouble and by saved by a noble knight in the dire moment...,
1755,,*,(Why there must be danger in her story...?),
1756,,Aquaris,"Don't look at me like this, I have a hard life!",
1757,,Aquaris,Not everyone will have their umbrella blown away when taking a snap.,
1758,,Aquaris,And got photographed from a strange angle and reported as a monster by the News Agency.,
1759,,Aquaris,"After that, Michael wanted to take away my umbrella, so I hid in Sonya's Cafeteria for almost half a month...",
1760,,*,(So you are the food thief Sonya complained about?),
1761,,Aquaris,"Oh! There's another reason, the most important of all... Wait, what was it...? Oh, it's to help you!",
1762,,Aquaris,"Yes, it's to help you and save the world! How's that?",
1763,,*,(You just made up a reason even you wouldn't believe...),
1764,,*,So... You want to go out for fun?,
1765,,Aquaris,Yes--- No!!! I'm trying to help.,
1766,,*,"Okay, thank you for your concern. Go home now.",
1767,,Aquaris,Nonononononono! Why did you give Iron Fist a different answer? That's discrimination!,
1768,,Aquaris,"Oh, I got it! You must be worried about me finishing all your work and taking away your chance to show off!",
1769,,Aquaris,Don't worry! I'll leave the last hit to you!,
1770,,Aquaris,I've got experience in doing this!,
1771,,*,I don't need such babying! There's no need for that!,
1772,,*,Damn... She must have been sent by someone who hates me bad.,
1773,,Aquaris,Damn... It's harder to convince you than I thought. Maybe I should try something else...,
1774,,Aquaris,"But now, you've given me no choice.",
1775,,*,What else do you want?,
1776,,Aquaris,If you won't let me come with you...,
1777,,Aquaris,I'll tell everyone about this!,
1778,,*,(...She has no shame!),
1779,,Aquaris,Oh! You chose this time to leave means you don't want others to know.,
1780,,Aquaris,I'll tell the News Agency about this once I return! I will broadcast this on the radio...,
1781,,Aquaris,"I don't know your plan, but everyone will know where you are!",
1782,,Aquaris,How's THAT?,
1783,,*,Uh...,
1784,,Ithil,"Since you've mentioned this, maybe I'll bury you with this secret.",
1785,,,I didn't realize Ithil was listening to our conversation. She's offered me a helping hand... And a shiv aimed at Aquaris's ribs.,
1786,,Aquaris,Ahhh! Ithil!?,
1787,,Aquaris,"No, I won't say anything, I won't tell anyone about this, I swear! I swear upon Senpai's life!",
1788,,Aquaris,I won't skip class or sleep on duty and will do all my homework on time and return the books I forgot to return!,
1789,,Aquaris,"I will become a good student, a good person!",
1790,,Aquaris,Just don't kill meeeeeee!,
1791,,,"Aquaris just unloaded a massive apology in a blink of an eye, like she'd been practicing this for a long time.",
1792,,,"Her groveling was so masterful! If only she put in half this effort into training, she might even save the world...",
1793,,*,(Let's just ignore the lies in her apology.),
1794,,*,"Ithil... If you've been listening all along, you should have come earlier.",
1795,,Ithil,"I've already left the decision to you. Besides, your conversation was amusing.",
1796,,Ithil,But we're running out of time. I suggest you make it quick.,
1797,,*,Do you have any suggestions? I think it will be dangerous if Aquaris comes with us...,
1798,,Ithil,So what?,
1799,,*,Huh?,
1800,,Ithil,I actually like this girl.,
1801,,Ithil,I heard she defeated Guan Yin and got her out of infection. She will be a good teammate.,
1802,,Ithil,"Besides, if we let her go now, she will leak the message.",
1803,,*,"Oh, I almost forgot the damage she can do...",
1804,,*,"Judging from this, I can call Aquaris a qualified fighter...",
1805,,*,As well as the kind of person who can't keep a secret.,
1806,,*,"(Maybe she also leaked the story of ""Foehn""...)",
1807,,*,"Okay, since you feel it's OK....",
1808,,Ithil,Then let's move out now. We have no time to waste.,
1809,,,Ithil disappears in the forest.,
1810,,,Looks like she was there when tapping us.,
1811,,Aquaris,(Gasp)...,
1812,,Aquaris,(Cough)...,
1813,,,Aquaris looks alive again once Ithil is gone.,
1814,,Aquaris,(Deep breath)...,
1815,,Aquaris,That's... Horrible... I thought she really wanted to kill me...,
1816,,*,What's wrong with you?,
1817,,Aquaris,I was too shocked to breathe...,
1818,,Aquaris,Maybe my heart also forgot to beat.,
1819,,*,Are you faking your own death!?,
1820,,Aquaris,Am I the first one to be threatened by a legendary Valkyrie and live to tell the tale?,
1821,,Aquaris,"Haha... Got another story to brag about. Don't be too jealous, Senpai.",
1822,,*,...I should have let Ithil killed you...,
1823,Of course...,*,Whatever... Now we're good to go.,
1824,,Valeera,So~ We've got ourselves a squad of six. More than I predicted.,
1825,,Valeera,"It would be really hard if there was just me, Turin, and Ithil.",
1826,,Ithil,... This reminds me of when we were at war with Chaos. But now...,
1827,,Turin,The war against Chaos...,
1828,,*,(I almost forgot Turin is also here...),
1829,,*,"Turin, we're going...",
1830,,Turin,Yes... Ithil and Valeera have already filled me in.,
1831,,Turin,We're heading to the tribe of Hunters.,
1832,,*,Based on your history with the Hunters... This could get ugly.,
1833,,Turin,"Thanks for your concern… But don't worry too much, I'm prepared to finish what I started.",
1834,,Turin,No matter how they treat me... I will pay back what I owe them.,
1835,,Turin,"Besides, maybe there's no one who knows me.",
1836,,Turin,All I need to worry about is how to apologize to Psychic as I left right after joining Animal Welfare Club...,
1837,,*,That's a relief. Guilt might affect your decisions.,
1838,,*,And I believe that someone doesn't need such care...,
1839,,Aquaris,"Yay! I can finally have some fun... No, I mean... Wait, why are we here again?",
1840,,*,You joined us without asking the reason?,
1841,,Ithil,"...In general, there are some tools with special powers hidden around this world. They're called Antiques.",
1842,,Ithil,"According to Valeera's research, the Antique we're looking for can help us secure the Academy...",
1843,,Ithil,"Though you may already find some Antiques on campus,",
1844,,Ithil,those are artificial Antiques made by someone based on the originals. They're much weaker copies...,
1845,,Valeera,"For example, the Philosopher's Stone we found before could be an Antique.",
1846,,*,"""Could be""...?",
1847,,Valeera,"It was broken before I could research it adequately, so I'm not sure...",
1848,,Valeera,"Its fragments are now kept inside my library, but I still have no idea how to deal with them...",
1849,,Turin,…It was all my fault. I had no other choice…,
1850,,Valeera,"Oh, I'm not blaming you! I'm just saying now that Philosopher's Stone isn't any help to us.",
1851,,Aquaris,"So we're now going to search for an Antique, right? I got you now!",
1852,,Iron Fist,"So, where're we heading?",
1853,,Ithil,"During my absence, I've tried to collect some information about the Antiques. I have a rough idea.",
1854,,Ithil,The first location is not far away... I'll explain to you when we get there.,
1855,,Ithil,You can go ahead. I've got something to do. I'll catch up with you later.,
1856,,*,What happened?,
1857,,Ithil,I'll need to cover our tracks to avoid other visitors.,
1858,,Ithil,We cannot afford to let another Aquaris happen again.,
1859,,*,"Uh, I'm sorry...",
1860,,Aquaris,"Senpai gets the blame, hehe.",
1861,,*,"Have you noticed that a problem is called an ""Aquaris""?",
1862,,Valeera,"Alright, let's leave the work to Ithil and move forward!",
1863,,Iron Fist,? Is this...?,
1864,,*,What?,
1865,,Iron Fist,It's a letter from KongMing... I don't know she put that in my luggage.,
1866,,*,That's the kind of trick she would play.,
1867,,Iron Fist,"There're two letters... Senpai, this one's for you.",
1868,,*,For me?,
1869,Oath,KongMing,Senpai:,
1870,,KongMing,"If you're reading this letter, it means Iron Fist is heading out with you.",
1871,,KongMing,"Although I've already told you not to let Iron Fist join you, I can understand how stubborn she can become when she makes a decision.",
1872,,KongMing,"If she insists on joining your team, all we can do is to honor her choice.",
1873,,KongMing,Maybe this is the best option for her.,
1874,,KongMing,"Since your time is limited, I shall make this short.",
1875,,KongMing,"If Iron Fist joins you, there are 3 things you need to do.",
1876,,KongMing,1. Keep notes on the status of Iron Fist and her prosthetic arm.,
1877,,KongMing,"Currently, Iron Fist can handle some battles with low intensity,",
1878,,KongMing,"but if she joins a battle that's too fierce, her physical condition might deteriorate.",
1879,,KongMing,"Although this kind of problem can be recovered by taking rest, I'm not sure if there will be any sequels.",
1880,,KongMing,This is the best scenario when her prosthetic arm is functional.,
1881,,KongMing,"If her prosthetic arm gets damaged, don't let her engage in battle.",
1882,,KongMing,Otherwise it will cause irreversible damage to her body.,
1883,,KongMing,2. Find Sivney.,
1884,,KongMing,Sivney is the best inventor on campus.,
1885,,KongMing,She has made the prototypes of everything we now have.,
1886,,KongMing,"I've spent some time studying the devices she left behind, but to little avail.",
1887,,KongMing,"She even designed Iron Fist's prosthetic arm, so I believe there must be something we don't know about it.",
1888,,KongMing,"She went off the grid in recent years,",
1889,,KongMing,"but if she is the kind of the person the record described,",
1890,,KongMing,there's a great chance that you'll come across her on your trip.,
1891,,KongMing,Raphael and I cannot help Iron Fist anymore.,
1892,,KongMing,"If there's a cure for her, that must be by Sivney's hand.",
1893,,KongMing,"Until you find her, Iron Fist is on her own. Please look after her.",
1894,,KongMing,3.... Bring everyone back safely by any means necessary.,
1895,,KongMing,KongMing,
1896,,*,(...Of course she would predict what will happen.),
1897,,*,"(""Sivney""... It's the second time I've heard of this name.)",
1898,,*,(But who she is... What she can do... I have no idea...),
1899,,*,"(Don't worry, KongMing... I will bring everyone back safely...)",
1900,,*,"Alright... Iron Fist, let's go, everyone's waiting for us.",
1901,,*,...Iron Fist?,
1902,,,When I turned to Iron Fist...,
1903,,,I saw her crying with the letter in her hands.,
1904,,,She pocketed her letter and wiped away her tears.,
1905,,*,What's the matter?,
1906,,Iron Fist,"... No, don't worry.",
1907,,Iron Fist,I'm just... So happy... To have you and KongMing by my side...,
1908,,Iron Fist,Really...,
1909,,*,……,
1910,,Aquaris,Hey~ What's the hold up?,
1911,,Aquaris,Come on!,
1912,,*,Let's go.,
1913,,Iron Fist,Okay.,
1914,Ghost,Aquaris,(Gasp)... How much farther do we need to go?,
1915,,Turin,"We have fewer people than last time, so we should be moving faster.",
1916,,Turin,"According to my research, we should be able to reach our destination before dawn.",
1917,,Aquaris,"Before dawn... Uh, I wish we could rest until dawn.",
1918,,*,"But if we do so, it will be easier to locate us... Do you have a better reason to stay?",
1919,,Aquaris,Maybe you think there's nothing to worry about...,
1920,,Aquaris,But at night... There might be something else in this forest!,
1921,,*,Something else?,
1922,,Aquaris,You know... Misty... Transparent... Freezing...,
1923,,Valeera,You're worried about mist in the forest?,
1924,,Aquaris,No! I'm referring something that can float around...,
1925,,Iron Fist,Huh? Jellyfish can't survive on solid land…,
1926,,Aquaris,Seriously? It's so scary!,
1927,,Turin,Key word acquired. I think I know what Aquaris is trying to describe.,
1928,,Turin,Are you referring to a ghost?,
1929,,Aquaris,Don't say it!,
1930,,Turin,I cannot understand. Ghosts also exist in daylight.,
1931,,Aquaris,Don't tell me that! You're scaring me even more!!,
1932,,*,Wraith might have played some tricks on her...,
1933,,Valeera,"Don't worry... There won't be any ghosts here, but perhaps something else will appear.",
1934,,Aquaris,"Nyah... I feel even worse now! Thanks, Valeera.",
1935,,Chaos Creature,Waaaaaaagh!!,
1936,,Aquaris,Aiyyyeee!,
1937,,Valeera,Seriously? Here?,
1938,,*,Prepare for battle!,
1939,,Iron Fist,We're lucky... The enemy was not very strong.,
1940,,Aquaris,That attack came as a surprise... Thank god it was something we could defeat.,
1941,,*,...This must be the Chaos creature Student Union worried about...,
1942,,*,Looks like some of them escaped the patrol team.,
1943,,Valeera,But where did they come from?,
1944,,*,I don't know... That's what we're trying to find out.,
1945,,Valeera,"Yes, you're right.",
1946,,Turin,"Wait, there's something else...",
1947,,Aquaris,NOOOOO!!! Must be the ghost spawned from the body of the defeated Chaos creature!!!,
1948,,Ithil,Think again.,
1949,,Aquaris,"A ghost...!? Wait, it's Ithil!?",
1950,,,Ithil revealed herself from the trees without making any noise.,
1951,,,"If she didn't say anything, we would have never noticed her.",
1952,,,... Maybe she's actually a ghost.,
1953,,,But something else caught my attention... Ithil was holding something in her hand.,
1954,,Turin,Is that Rumpy?,
1955,Curious Cat,Rumpy,Meow! Meow!,
1956,,,Rumpy got captured by Ithil and tried to make some useless threatening gestures.,
1957,,,"Considering what this cat did in the past, I have to admit that it was funny to see him in this position.",
1958,,,But...,
1959,,*,Ithil... Why is he here?,
1960,,Ithil,I'm also confused.,
1961,,Ithil,"When I tried to cover our tracks, I found this little one.",
1962,,Ithil,Seems he has been following us for a while.,
1963,,Turin,Rumpy... Do you wish to come with us?,
1964,,Rumpy,Meow! Meow!,
1965,,Iron Fist,Sounds like he wants to join us...,
1966,,*,"According to the mural we found last time, he might belong to the tribe.",
1967,,Ithil,That makes sense. He acted differently during the last trip.,
1968,,Ithil,... Maybe he can be useful in this part of our journey.,
1969,,Ithil,"He's not a trouble-maker, right?",
1970,,*,Well... I think he can be a good boy. I still suggest we reach Psychic to make certain of this.,
1971,,Turin,"Unfortunately, she's not here...",
1972,,Rumpy,Meow! Meow!,
1973,,*,All I know right now is that he's very angry about his current situation...,
1974,,Ithil,"Fair enough, I will let him go. But I hope he won't be so jumpy like last time.",
1975,,Rumpy,Meow!!!,
1976,,,"Once regained his freedom, Rumpy hid behind Turin and starts to hiss (roaring in his mind) at Ithil.",
1977,,,But at least his claws were put away.,
1978,,,... Or maybe he was still scared of Ithil's shivs.,
1979,,Turin,Be a good boy. You need to be nice to others.,
1980,,Rumpy,Meow！,
1981,,Iron Fist,But I still wonder... Why did Rumpy leave his tribe and come to the Academy?,
1982,,*,...I'm afraid only he himself knows the reason.,
1983,,Rumpy,Meow! Meow! Meow!,
1984,,Iron Fist,"Sorry, we can't understand you...",
1985,,*,Then we'll figure it out ourselves... Let's go now.,
1986,Farewell to the Past,Aquaris,(Gasp)... We've finally arrived at the riverbank... I'm tired already.,
1987,,Iron Fist,On the other side lies the wasteland of Foehn.,
1988,,,On the two sides of the river sat different scenes,
1989,,,The river stood like a border that separated two different worlds.,
1990,,Valeera,Let me cast a spell!,
1991,,Valeera,"We're going across the river in the same way, just like last time!",
1992,,*,This view is not something you see every day...,
1993,,Valeera,"Alright, let's get across the river!",
1994,,*,Okay... Let's go!,
1995,,Ithil,"Remember, don't even dream of returning alone.",
1996,,Iron Fist,……！？,
1997,,Ithil,"Before we finish our mission, it will be impossible for Valeera to help you cross the river again.",
1998,,Valeera,"Why? I can help them... Uh! I mean, you won't be getting any help in getting across the river any time soon!",
1999,,Valeera,(Ithil is staring at me again... Like she's threatening me.),
2000,,Ithil,"Which means, once you get across the river, the only way to return is to swim back.",
2001,,*,(Sounds like someone really swam across this river before...),
2002,,Ithil,"Unlike the Academy, this world is full of danger.",
2003,,Ithil,Maybe you think you're ready for what you're getting into. I'd say you're ill-prepared.,
2004,,Ithil,"After crossing this river, you will be far away from your home, from your friends, from your normal life.",
2005,,Ithil,You will need to overcome all the tough battles you may encounter. This is a responsibility that you will carry with you into the future.,
2006,,Ithil,"... If anyone wants to go home, this is your last chance. I won't blame you if you choose to return.",
2007,,Ithil,"But if you choose to go on, mark my words.",
2008,,Iron Fist,... Please don't bother. I... I have made up my mind.,
2009,,Iron Fist,(Even if I fail to survive this journey... At least I spend my last hours with Senpai...),
2010,,Turin,Me too. I have something to pay back my debt.,
2011,,Rumpy,Meow!,
2012,,*,"And... Ithil, you are wrong in one way.",
2013,,Ithil,What's that?,
2014,,*,We still have each other.,
2015,,Ithil,"If you think that's a consolation, that's pretty lame.",
2016,,*,Awwww... I thought I had a nice speech.,
2017,,Ithil,But... You're right... I'm not alone this time...,
2018,,Ithil,Ha... You are right this time.,
2019,,Aquaris,(What should I do... I missed my chance to go back...!),
2020,,Aquaris,"(After Ithil's speech, I've already decided to return...)",
2021,,Aquaris,(But everyone said they've decided to stay before I asked to quit... I will be so embarrassed if I say it now!!!?),
2022,,Aquaris,(Why is everyone so serious... Even the cat shows determination...),
2023,,Aquaris,(...Maybe it's time to make a little sacrifice to promote my own status...!),
2024,,Aquaris,(Cough)...,
2025,,Aquaris,I've decided to stay!!!,
2026,,Everyone else,…………,
2027,,Aquaris,Why you are looking at me like that?,
2028,,Aquaris,I've already considered this millions of times!,
2029,,Aquaris,Just like I had battle to the death with my own fear!,
2030,,*,Uh... Just do your best.,
2031,,Aquaris,Uh... You don't seem like have much faith in me...,
2032,,Ithil,... Looks like everybody has decided to stay.,
2033,,Ithil,Very well then. Prepare to say farewell to your normal life!,
2034,,Valeera,Why do you all look a bit of shaky...? The ice bridge I build is solid. It won't break!,
2035,,,"We had all experienced crossing the ice bridge before, but now there was something else that made us hesitant.",
2036,,,The bridge became more like a link between two worlds.,
2037,,,"Even though we made preparations before, we were still quite nervous about saying farewell to our past.",
2038,,,No one was ready for an unknown future.,
2039,Change,Rumpy,Meow! Meow!,
2040,,Turin,Rumpy! I told you not to run off alone!,
2041,,Turin,Why is he still running this fast!?,
2042,,*,At least we can still follow his tracks. Seems like he's trying to lead us somewhere.,
2043,,*,I feel the aura of Chaos is fading away as we get further from the Academy... Is that my misconception?,
2044,,Turin,I thought I was the only one with this feeling.,
2045,,Valeera,Then it's not a coincidence. There must be something on campus attracting the Chaos.,
2046,,Valeera,It could even be the Academy itself.,
2047,,Iron Fist,The Academy is attracting the Chaos?,
2048,,Valeera,Chaos creatures always try to get to somewhere with lots of energy by instinct.,
2049,,Valeera,"You can consider the Academy as a source of energy, so it's understandable that it's attractive to the Chaos.",
2050,,Valeera,But I still have no idea how those Chaos creatures are spawned. It's like they appeared from nowhere...,
2051,,Turin,Yes... We still have much to learn about Chaos.,
2052,,Turin,We cannot even confirm if Dire is truly defeated…,
2053,,Ithil,... And here we are.,
2054,,Iron Fist,This is... Our camp?,
2055,,*,"Wow, almost nothing left.",
2056,,Aquaris,Uh... Wait a minute. Is all this destruction done by a Foehn?,
2057,,Turin,I think so...,
2058,,Aquaris,So... If a Foehn arrives when we're asleep...,
2059,,Aquaris,Will we even be able to run away!? I'm so scared...,
2060,,Valeera,No need to worry! You have underestimated my power! I've already prepared for this kind of situation.,
2061,,Valeera,"Last time, I set a barrier around the camp to protect all the girls from Foehn.",
2062,,*,Then explain the mess here… I remember we're almost killed last time by that Foehn…,
2063,,Valeera,"It requires energy to maintain the barrier! If we don't need that barrier, why should I charge it?",
2064,,Valeera,It won't happen if I have enough time to prepare.,
2065,,*,"Are you prepared just in case, Valeera?",
2066,,Valeera,... Sorry! I'm preparing now!,
2067,,*,(... We were so close to dying...),
2068,,Aquaris,Wait! We're building a camp in the same place?,
2069,,Aquaris,"Even we can set up a barrier, it's still not safe... There might be a second accident...",
2070,,Aquaris,Let's find a cave or a place Foehn can't reach.,
2071,,Ithil,Oh... That's a good idea. I can show you what we found last time.,
2072,,Ithil,The cave should be a good place for us to settle down.,
2073,,Ithil,"After building a camp, we'll still have enough time to rest.",
2074,,Valeera,…Have I lost their trust?,
2075,Sinking Feeling,*,So this is the cave you mentioned.,
2076,,Ithil,"Yes, but something is wrong...",
2077,,Ithil,"Seems like this place was cleaned up after we left... These tracks look different, too...",
2078,,Aquaris,"Let's just build our camp... After all this walking, I'm beat.",
2079,,Aquaris,All I want is a full night's sleep.,
2080,,Ithil,... That's also an option since everyone is tired.,
2081,,Ithil,I can show you what we found tomorrow.,
2082,,*,Building the camp again... It's not a pleasant experience.,
2083,,Turin,"Don't worry, Senpai, we'll help you this time.",
2084,,Iron Fist,"If we work together, the job will be done in no time...",
2085,,Valeera,This place doesn't need any barrier...,
2086,,Valeera,I cannot help in building the camp... This is embarrassing...,
2087,,Aquaris,"Don't worry, Valeera!",
2088,,Aquaris,"I'm as useless as you are, so we can comfort each other. That makes us two useful again!",
2089,,Aquaris,"With Rumpy here, we can even form a group called Tri-Loser. Yay!",
2090,,Rumpy,Meow~,
2091,,Valeera,That's not something we call consolation...,
2092,,*,"Aquaris, quit standing around and get back to work!",
2093,,*,Done and done!,
2094,,Iron Fist,That was way easier than I thought.,
2095,,*,"Exactly... I never knew you were so good at setting up camps, Turin.",
2096,,Turin,"I learned how to assemble a tent before, so all we need to do is to improvise according to the terrain.",
2097,,*,(Then why you didn't help me last time...),
2098,,Ithil,"Thanks to your hard work, camp is set up. Let's rest right now.",
2099,,Ithil,We'll be moving out tomorrow.,
2100,,*,But... Why must I share a tent with a cat?,
2101,,Aquaris,You're expecting to share with someone else?,
2102,,*,"Nonono, that's not what I'm trying to say ---",
2103,,*,(Rumpy is smelly. Hope he won't bite...),
2104,,Iron Fist,We don't have any tents left.,
2105,,*,Why don't we let Rumpy sleep outside?,
2106,,Rumpy,Hiss!!~Meow!!!,
2107,,*,"Calm down, kitty!",
2108,,*,(Just one night...),
2109,,Valeera,"Ithil, you'd better sleep early tonight~",
2110,,Ithil,Don't worry about me. There should be someone to keep watch at night.,
2111,,*,We will have a shift change later.,
2112,,Ithil,Thank you.,
2113,,Valeera,"Don't be too strict to yourself, Senpai.",
2114,,*,"Haha, don't worry about me.",
2115,,*,"(Compared with their responsibility, I have nothing to complain about)",
2116,,Ithil,……,
2117,Nightmare,*,(I don't feel good.),
2118,,*,(Where am I…?),
2119,,,I was surrounded by darkness and couldn't feel my arms and legs.,
2120,,,"Actually, I was like a part of this darkness.",
2121,,*,(What's going on?),
2122,,*,"(Is that another one of Li's tricks, or the Chaos is approaching?)",
2123,,,"I tried to move and escape that place, but my efforts amounted to nothing.",
2124,,*,"(Damn, I still have work to do. I can't afford to be trapped here.)",
2125,,*,(Is there any way to get out of this space?),
2126,,*,(At least there's some light to show me the way...),
2127,,,"Once I had this thought, a light started to glow within this space.",
2128,,,"Before I could register the light, the space started to take my breath away.",
2129,,*,(What's this again?),
2130,,*,(Gasp)...,
2131,,*,It was a dream?,
2132,,*,When did Rumpy climb on my chest? This must be the reason for my nightmare.,
2133,,*,"But, it's about time for my shift. I should go and relieve Ithil now.",
2134,,*,This cat on my chest might go mad if I disturb his sleep. I'd better be careful.,
2135,Ithil under moon,*,Ithil?,
2136,,,"I saw Ithil standing outside the cave, counting the stars.",
2137,,,Maybe this will be a correct judgment if her eye-mask is off.,
2138,,Ithil,"Ah, here you are.",
2139,,*,I will take over from here. You'd better go to sleep at once.,
2140,,Ithil,"Don't worry, I've gotten used to it.",
2141,,Ithil,Don't get too tired during your shift.,
2142,,*,You had this kind of experience before?,
2143,,Ithil,"In the past, I once survived without sleeping for several weeks.",
2144,,*,Several weeks? I thought several nights would be enough to ruin a human.,
2145,,Ithil,"I've developed some special skills to achieve this. Of course, I will need to rest longer afterward.",
2146,,Ithil,All thanks to Li. He made us stronger so we can endure worse situations.,
2147,,*,Li is responsible for this...?,
2148,,Ithil,"After you know us longer, you learn more about us.",
2149,,Ithil,"Special abilities to aid us in battles, stronger physical traits, and...immortality.",
2150,,Ithil,"This is a gift, but also a curse that blocks us away from the ordinary.",
2151,,*,Uh... I thought the others can understand you?,
2152,,Ithil,I advise you stop being so childish at once.,
2153,,*,... You call that childish?,
2154,,Ithil,"Ain't that the truth? Even the D.E.F cannot work together with the rest of the Academy, not to mention someone doesn't even in the same race.",
2155,,Ithil,I'd rather have an enemy in public than a traitor unknown.,
2156,,*,But... We have once cooperated with D.E.F.,
2157,,Ithil,"Yet, now we're hiding from them.",
2158,,Ithil,"We can't afford the time to let us understand each other, that's the cruel true reality.",
2159,,*,...,
2160,,Ithil,"... Actually, after a hundred-years trip, I have started to understand how Kratos and Saint think.",
2161,,Ithil,"Our lives incomplete, so we won't live a full life just like others.",
2162,,Ithil,"Apparently, nobody will happily accept her fate as a machine built for battle.",
2163,,Ithil,"But this is what we're offered, we need to live with that.",
2164,,*,……,
2165,,Ithil,"Sometime very soon, you will know that there're many people in this world sharing different thoughts.",
2166,,Ithil,"But you don't belong to any one of them, for us, the campus security is always the first priority.",
2167,,Ithil,"When it matters, you must choose your side.",
2168,,Ithil,"Of course, if you cannot do that... I will help you.",
2169,,*,Ithil... Why you become so serious when it comes to the Academy...?,
2170,,*,"Of course, I will also protect the Academy, but you... Your word sounds like you are willing to hurt others for the Academy.",
2171,,Ithil,"You're right, I will, if things can't be helped...",
2172,,*,But... Is that really necessary?,
2173,,Ithil,"We have infinity time, so we have to see in a bigger picture.",
2174,,Ithil,I can still remember what we suffered during the last war against Chaos... And I'm not letting it happen again.,
2175,,Ithil,"Valeera, Sivney, and me... We helped ""Li"" to build this Academy from the ruins.",
2176,,Ithil,"But that's not enough, so a spent more than a hundred years outside to find a way to defeat Chaos once and for all.",
2177,,Ithil,"I won't let anything to interfere and ruin my plan, I'll protect all of you.",
2178,,*,I like what you're selling.,
2179,,*,But... I still disagree.,
2180,,Ithil,That won't matter. I will still carry out my plan.,
2181,,*,"Like you just said before, you will help me to make my choice when it really matters?",
2182,,Ithil,Exactly.,
2183,,*,... I won't let the situation that really matters happen.,
2184,,*,I'll find a way to save everyone.,
2185,,*,I believe you will change your mind when I achieve all that.,
2186,,Ithil,Haha! You're... Just like the old times...,
2187,,*,Just like the old times?,
2188,,Ithil,"Oh, forget that.",
2189,,Ithil,Well... Okay. If you can really do that. I wouldn't mind changing my mind.,
2190,,Ithil,"(Sigh)... That's enough, I'll need to have a rest.",
2191,,*,"Oh, sorry for the hold up.",
2192,,*,(Although it sounds Ithil knows a lot about Sivney... Maybe I should ask her later),
2193,,Ithil,No... It was a good conversation.,
2194,,Ithil,Saving us all...? Interesting... Hope you won't get yourself killed.,
2195,Karma,Ithil,"By the way, be more cautious.",
2196,,*,Why?,
2197,,Ithil,I believe someone was watching us last time when we get here.,
2198,,Ithil,"And these tracks inside the cave, here is the evidence.",
2199,,*,Huh?... A monitor you mean? Is that before the last Foehn or some time earlier?,
2200,,Ithil,I noticed that after the Foehn passed... But I think maybe she's been there a long time ago.,
2201,,*,"But that's weird... I mean if that's before the last Foehn, there were still some bushes that can be used as cover.",
2202,,*,But after Foehn burns everything out... Where can the monitor be?,
2203,,Ithil,... Maybe she's got some other covers to use.,
2204,,*,Then... Maybe these caves are also one of those covers?,
2205,,Ithil,"... That actually makes sense, as Hunter's tribe is still living in the caves here, even after the forest fire finished.",
2206,,Ithil,I wouldn't be surprised if they have already built tunnels to connect all these caves.,
2207,,*,Uh... This doesn't feel right.,
2208,,Ithil,We maybe are guarding a wrong position... Let's return immediately!,
2209,,？？？,Ahhhhhh!,
2210,,*,That's... Aquaris!?,
2211,,Ithil,Of course...,
2212,,*,Is everyone alright!?,
2213,,,"When we get back to the cave, we found the bonfire we lit for light and warmth is killed, and the cave is in total darkness.",
2214,,,"Although we can still tell the positions of the teammates with the light from Rumpy's flame, Iron  Fist's prosthetic arm, and Turin's glow.",
2215,,,"But, the enemy's location is unknown.",
2216,,Turin,Finally! Senpai and Ithil have arrived!,
2217,,Turin,"Be cautious, the hostile is strong!",
2218,,Ithil,Stay back!,
2219,,Rumpy,Meow! Meow! Meow!,
2220,,,Ithil engaged the enemy hidden in darkness... Turin and Rumpy seem can locate the targets in darkness.,
2221,,,I can see something sharp tied with a chain swinging in the air... The enemy is humanoid?,
2222,,Turin,Alright... Now we have the upper hand...,
2223,,Valeera,Ithil! Let me aid you!,
2224,,Ithil,Get her!,
2225,,？？？,Tch…,
2226,,Ithil,She's trying to get away!,
2227,,Rumpy,Meow! Meow!,
2228,,？？？,What a... Traitor...,
2229,,Turin,Is that...!?,
2230,,,Ithil tries to get the enemies by tossing her shivs.,
2231,,,"But before the shivs reach their target, some flame in the form of a chain appears from nowhere and blocked them.",
2232,,,"In the flame, I can see a female runs into the deep of the cave.",
2233,,Aquaris,... Is it over? Can I get out from my umbrella now?,
2234,,Ithil,She ran away... But...,
2235,,*,Judging by her figure... She's a humanoid creature...,
2236,,Valeera,"And the flame we saw... That seems familiar, it feels just like when Phoenix is using her power...",
2237,,Aquaris,No way... Phoenix is here too?,
2238,,*,"It won't be, if Phoenix is here, she would light this entire place.",
2239,,*,And she has no reason to stand against us.,
2240,,Ithil,Is she from D.E.F? But how can they find where we are?,
2241,,*,No... If I guessed it right. She should be the guy who's been monitoring us.,
2242,,*,Maybe she's even a member Hunter's tribe?,
2243,,Iron Fist,"But... According to her reaction, she cannot be a servant...",
2244,,Iron Fist,Maybe there are some girls living outside the Academy... Even with Hunter's tribe?,
2245,,Ithil,"We'll soon find out... But now, we have a new subject to discuss.",
2246,,Turin,Yes. That's also what I'm thinking right now.,
2247,,Ithil,"Who does she refer as a ""Traitor""?",
2248,Traitor,*,"""Traitor""",
2249,,Ithil,... I have no memory about betraying anyone.,
2250,,Valeera,Me neither.,
2251,,Turin,"Uh... I did make mistakes... But those behaviors weren't a ""traitor"" would do...",
2252,,Iron Fist,"""Traitor""... That sounds...",
2253,,*,"Iron Fist, do you have any idea?",
2254,,Iron Fist,No... I just think it sounds familiar... But...,
2255,,Turin,It won't be Iron Fist anyway. She never did anything wrong.,
2256,,*,So...,
2257,,Aquaris,Huh? Me!? You're doubting my loyalty!?,
2258,,*,No... Don't get so nervous... We're just trying to figure out what does she mean.,
2259,,Aquaris,Well... I did skip classes and steal cookies from the office.,
2260,,Aquaris,And left my job for fun... But you cannot call me a traitor!,
2261,,Aquaris,I won't be surprised if anyone comes for me right now though...,
2262,,Valeera,We all should have never seen her before... That's weird.,
2263,,Turin,But if there's who might know her... I can think of someone... Some cat...,
2264,,Rumpy,Meow!,
2265,,*,You!?,
2266,,Rumpy,Meow! Meow!,
2267,,Turin,Sounds like a positive response...,
2268,,Ithil,Well... He's really hiding something.,
2269,,Iron Fist,But even if we know that... What should we do? We don't know what he's saying...,
2270,,*,Can we just... Let him guide us the way?,
2271,,Ithil,That's an idea. Especially when we cannot understand him.,
2272,,Ithil,It's better for us to find that monitor.,
2273,,*,So... Can you please show us the way?,
2274,,Rumpy,(Roars)...,
2275,,,Rumpy ignored me and got himself inside our tent.,
2276,,*,Did he return for sleep?,
2277,,Aquaris,"I think, we should leave it tomorrow too.",
2278,,Iron Fist,Yes... Rumpy's roars woke us up... I still feel woozy now.,
2279,,*,So Rumpy is also the first to be attacked...,
2280,,Turin,"I've had enough rest, so I can guard you now.",
2281,,*,"Let me join you, this is supposed to be my shift.",
2282,,Valeera,Well... I'd better have more sleep.,
2283,,Valeera,Fatigue will affect my performance as a Mage.,
2284,,*,Then... Go to sleep now.,
2285,,*,Seems we're relying on a cat tomorrow.,
2286,,*,That doesn't feel so good...,
2287,Face to face,Ithil,Is everyone ready now?,
2288,,Aquaris,Aquaris is ready!,
2289,,Iron Fist,Yes... The adjustment of my prosthetic arm is also completed. I'm ready to go.,
2290,,Valeera,"Okay, what about Senpai and Turin...",
2291,,*,I can use a rest...,
2292,,Turin,I'm very happy! I let Senpai told be everything happened on campus during the night watch!,
2293,,Turin,"Seems I've missed a lot of fun, but it still feels so good to know that...",
2294,,*,I thought you can check the record of the Academy...,
2295,,Turin,I do! But it's better if I can be told by someone face to face!,
2296,,*,What's the difference?,
2297,,*,(She will become the best friend of Raphael...),
2298,,Ithil,So... Where's our hero today?,
2299,,*,Standing right in front of you?,
2300,,Ithil,"Sorry, but I'm not referring to you.",
2301,,*,You're not mentioning the one I'm thinking right?,
2302,,Rumpy,Meow!,
2303,,Turin,Our hero is ready!,
2304,,*,... Come on!!!,
2305,,Valeera,"Don't get pissed, be a good boy, there can be 2 heroes in a story.",
2306,,*,Okay... Let's become best friends!,
2307,,Rumpy,Grrrrrrr....,
2308,,*,"I understand what you said, so I can get my hero title back by kicking his ass right?",
2309,,Valeera,Uh... Maybe not.,
2310,,Aquaris,"Haha, just let them fight, Senpai doesn't stand a 100% win rate.",
2311,,*,Let's stop the nonsense here.,
2312,,Ithil,Let's stop the nonsense here.,
2313,,Ithil,"We're exposed, so we'd better make it quick.",
2314,,Ithil,"Rumpy, please lead the way.",
2315,,Rumpy,(Roars)...M--Meow~,
2316,,,"Rumpy seems once thought to threaten Ithil... But on the next second, he gives up.",
2317,,,It's just like he's being a bully who is afraid of Ithil.,
2318,,Aquaris,How long have we been walking... I think we have lost our direction.,
2319,,Aquaris,Everything looks familiar here... Are we lost?,
2320,,Turin,"Don't worry, I've recorded our path and formed a map in my database. We're surely moving forward.",
2321,,Aquaris,"Wow... That's so convenient, can I get the same device...?",
2322,,*,(KongMing won't be happy if she hears that...),
2323,,Iron Fist,We've brought enough illuminating equipment with us this time...,
2324,,Iron Fist,So it will be easier for us to fight without natural light.,
2325,,Valeera,"But even we have solved the problems caused by darkness, it's still not a suitable place for a fight...",
2326,,Valeera,"Ithil's shiv will be easier to miss, and my magic might cause collapse...",
2327,,Aquaris,Don't speak anymore! Valeera!,
2328,,Aquaris,Every time you open your mouse I feel like we'll be facing devastation...,
2329,,Valeera,My words have effects like that...?,
2330,,Ithil,"Inside this kind of cave, I'll also be affected.",
2331,,Ithil,"It feels totally different. The information is from all directions, they can be very disturbing.",
2332,,*,Sounds like a bad news...,
2333,,Ithil,I can still stay sharp and perform better than others.,
2334,,Ithil,"But the one we're tracking has the field advantage, making her moves unpredictable. Not to mention all these byroads we can see here.",
2335,,*,Don't list the dangers like they are nothing!,
2336,,Aquaris,Byroads... So you mean the enemy might assault us from behind?,
2337,,Aquaris,"Ahhh, I won't be walking in the tail anymore, Senpai, take my position!",
2338,,*,You're helpless...,
2339,,Rumpy,Meow!,
2340,,Ithil,……,
2341,,*,What is it?,
2342,,Iron Fist,A girl...,
2343,,Catgirl,……,
2344,Lesson Learned,Catgirl,...(Meow) Don't come any closer.,
2345,,*,"Did she say ""Meow""?",
2346,,Catgirl,...(Meow) Traitor... You're coming with me.,
2347,,Rumpy,Meow! Meow! Meow!,
2348,,Iron Fist,"So Rumpy is really a ""Traitor""...",
2349,,*,But... At least she can understand our words.,
2350,,*,We're from Yume Academy to find something...,
2351,,Catgirl,I know who you are... Rivals...,
2352,,Catgirl,And the witch over there...,
2353,,*,Witch... She's referring to...,
2354,,Turin,...,
2355,,Catgirl,"...(Meow) Return, and I won't hurt you.",
2356,,Catgirl,"I'll treat you as enemy if you take one more step forward, to the Sacred Ground.",
2357,,Valeera,We must have done something right.,
2358,,Valeera,The Antique we're looking for must be hidden in that Sacred Place.,
2359,,Valeera,"Accordingly, she must be that priest we saw on that mural...",
2360,,Catgirl,! You're my enemies!,
2361,,Aquaris,This is not the best time to talk about this!,
2362,,Ithil,Leave the talking after battle.,
2363,,Ithil,Let's capture her first!,
2364,,Valeera,"(Gasp)... Even with the field advantage, it's still amazing for her to make it here.",
2365,,Ithil,"Alright, give up already, and tell us all what you know.",
2366,,*,Have you been planning for this all along...?,
2367,,Ithil,"Yes, what?",
2368,,*,No... I just thought you should let me do the talking first...,
2369,,Catgirl,...(Meow) Damned enchantress!,
2370,,Catgirl,You want to manipulate me too?,
2371,,Iron Fist,What do you mean? Enchantress? Manipulate?,

2376,,*,... Then can you at least tell me your name? My name is *.,
2377,,Catgirl,……,
2378,,*,(She's so hard to communicate with),
2379,,*,See? Here we have one of your kind in our team.,
2380,,*,This buddy... I mean this cute cat has already become our friends.,
2381,,*,I believe we can erase our misunderstandings soon.,

2386,,*,(Wait...?),
2387,,,Rumpy approached the girl and said something to her.,
2388,,,I have no idea what he said...,
2389,,Catgirl,...(Meow) I won't rely on others...,
2390,,Catgirl,But if you're telling me the truth...,
2391,,Catgirl,...(Meow) You said your name is *?,

2399,,Valeera,She's not aiming at us!,
2400,,Turin,Oh no... We need to move now!,
2401,,Aquaris,? Why do you look so afraid?,
2402,,Valeera,She aimed at the ceiling! The collapse has begun!,
2403,,Aquaris,Oh no... My umbrella is not useful against rocks! Run for your lives!,
2404,,Iron Fist,Wait... Senpai...!,
2405,,Valeera,(Cough)... Looks like the collapse has ended. Is everyone alright?,
2406,,Ithil,I'm okay.,
2407,,Iron Fist,... Me too.,
2408,,Turin,System fully functional.,
2409,,Aquaris,I thought I'd be dead!,
2410,,Valeera,"I see that as a ""yes"" then...",
2411,,Valeera,"Luckily, the illuminating equipment is not damaged. Other wise we'll need to rely on magic for light, that's not a good choice.",

2413,,Iron Fist,Senpai... Where is Senpai?,
2414,,Aquaris,Is Senpai... Failed to make it...?,
2415,,Iron Fist,……,

2420,,Iron Fist,Yes... Senpai won't end this way.,
2421,,Ithil,Don't worry too much... I saw that girl took him away before the collapse.,
2422,,Ithil,Rumpy was with her... I guess they've planned for that moment.,
2423,,Ithil,Tch... I should have predicted this.,
2424,,Iron Fist,Then we need to find Senpai fast...!,
2425,,Valeera,But...,
2426,,Turin,Our path is blocked... All I can provide from my map is the route for us to return.,
2427,,Aquaris,Which means... We don't know where we need to go...,
2428,,Iron Fist,"But, we cannot just leave Senpai here!",
2429,,Ithil,Calm down.,
2430,,Ithil,"Although we've lost track of Rumpy and Senpai, but we're close to our primary target.",
2431,,Ithil,"According to what the girl said, we're really close.",
2432,,Ithil,"There are so many paths here, so there must be another way.",
2433,,Valeera,So... Which way?,
2434,,Ithil,"Turin, are you still recording our location right?",
2435,,Turin,"Yes, I am.",
2436,,Ithil,"So, with Turin, we won't get lost.",
2437,,Ithil,"And according to the legend of Hunter's tribe, their Sacred Ground should be close to a volcano.",
2438,,Ithil,"And the only volcano nearby is Hecrum, which is in our north-west direction.",
2439,,Iron Fist,"So, we're able to find them... As long as we move towards that direction?",
2440,,Ithil,"It's just my theory, but at least it's a start.",
2441,,Ithil,"After all, we don't have much to do on the ground.",

2453,,Mio,Our savior.,

10000002,,*,"(Well, since Hunters can build their own civilization, it's not surprising that some other kinds of civilizations exist in this world…)",

2457,,*,...An explanation would be nice?,
2458,,Mio,……,
2459,,,Mio keeps staring at me. It looks like she's thinking.,
2460,,*,"Uh...! Wait, what are you doing!?",
2461,,,Mio suddenly approaches me and starts to smell me.,
2462,,,I have to admit. It's really a situation I would like to experience if she's not my enemy--- But this fact makes her behavior looks like a predator smelling its prey.,
2463,,Mio,"Meow... You smell, strange. I wonder how a person like you would be our savior.",
2464,,*,I don't even know what should your savior do.,
2465,,Mio,"The chosen one will link the sacred flame with his body, and guide us out of the god-forsaken place by its light.",
2466,,*,What does that mean exactly?,
2467,,Mio,Meow... You will soon find out. Right after we make sure that you're not our enemy.,
2468,,*,(Why do they make everything so complicated...?),
2469,,Mio,Meow... The preparations for the ritual will start very soon. Just stay here.,
2470,,*,"Well, I've got nothing else to do here...",
2471,,,Mio leaves without responding to my last sentence.,
2472,,*,"(Okay, this is a chance for me to find a way out of here)",
2473,,*,(The cave... I can see paths leading to many different directions. The chance of getting rescued is slim because of this. They must have covered my eyes in case I remembered the path).,
2474,,*,"(But... Even with a map of all these tunnels, I still cannot make it out of here...)",
2475,,*,(But maybe this can help...),
2476,,*,(...The Servant controller developed by Turin. If I can get my hands on this...),

2481,,Rumpy,Meow! Meow!,
2482,,,I don't really know what Rumpy is trying to say. But I can tell that he doesn't feel guilty at all about what he has done... That really pisses me off.,
2483,,*,I shouldn't have asked you... You don't speak human at all... But why are you here? Just to laugh at me?,
2484,,Rumpy,Meow~,
2485,,,Rumpy jumped on my back and touched the rope that is tieing up my hands.,
2486,,*,"Huh? Are you here to free me? I'm so sorry I have treated you so rudely in the past. Since you've turned out to be kind, I'll be nice to you from now on...",
2487,,,"After a while, Rumpy leaves with a smile (at least I think that was a smile).",
2488,,*,"Huh...? I'm not untied? Rumpy, get back here! You've made a mistake! Can you at least bite it off? HEY!!!",
2489,,*,(He is still staying here to laugh at me... Damn it!),
2490,Windtalker,Aquaris,Am I wrong or have we been here before?,
2491,,Iron Fist,I think... This place looks very familiar...,
2492,,Turin,Well... According to my tachograph. The new passage leads us to an old location.,
2493,,Ithil,We underestimated the Hunters too much. These passages were laid out this way on purpose to confuse their enemies.,
2494,,Aquaris,"Oh no... There are so many tunnels down here, how can we possibly find the right path?!",
2495,,Valeera,Uh... Maybe we can check all the passages one by one... Forget that. It might take us more than a century!,
2496,,Iron Fist,"Ithil, is it possible for you to track them according to their marks?",
2497,,Ithil,"If they didn't intend to leave some additional footprints to confuse us, this could be a good idea.",
2498,,Aquaris,What about tracking them by their smell? Even Bruno can smell my hidden snacks from a mile away.,
2499,,Aquaris,Oh! I wasn't trying to compare Ithil to a dog! That's just an innocent example!,
2500,,Ithil,Well... Bruno actually has a better nose. But... I should say this is a good idea.,
2501,,Aquaris,Wut? You really want to track them with your nose?,
2502,,Ithil,"No, call that an inspiration. But I can actually sense the airflow.",
2503,,Ithil,"In order to maintain the oxygen supply in this cave, the Hunter's hideout should be designed to connect to the surface. This isn't something they can avoid.",
2504,,Aquaris,Uh... So...?,
2505,,Ithil,…………,
2506,,Ithil,"Turin, how long have we been inside this cave?",
2507,,Turin,Uh... It's already the night of the second day now? Why are you asking me?,
2508,,Ithil,...Because something is wrong. The airflow shouldn't work this way...,
2509,,Iron Fist,So... What does that mean?,
2510,,Ithil,I'm not sure. But at least we can know which direction is correct from it.,
2511,,Aquaris,I never knew we could use this kind of information when tracing something.,
2512,,Valeera,"Just learn as much as you can, and your efforts will be paid off!",
2513,,Aquaris,That's very persuasive for someone that isn't me.,
2514,,Iron Fist,"(Senpai... Hold on, we're coming for you)",
2515,Wrong Expectancy,Mio,Meow... The ritual is ready. Come with me.,
2516,,*,"(They loosen the ropes on my leg, but my hands are still not free...)",
2517,,,"(Rumpy never returned for a second time, and the other Hunters just kept on watching me from a distance...)",
2518,,*,(The chance for me to make it out of here is too slim. Guess I will need to follow their orders...),
2519,,*,...Can I ask what is the ritual about? And about the test you mentioned... Is it dangerous?,
2520,,Mio,Meow... It is not dangerous if you're the one mentioned in the prophecy.,
2521,,*,(...So it's going to be very dangerous...),
2522,,Mio,"Meow... I'll lead you to the holy flame, and you will have a vision from that.",
2523,,*,Oh... That doesn't sound so dangerous.,
2524,,Mio,"Meow... Then, you will step into the flame. Our god will grant you power for that.",
2525,,*,Wait wait wait! This sounds too weird! I doubt if anyone can leave without getting harmed? Have you ever tried this before?,
2526,,Mio,Meow... I used to be inside the flame for a day.,
2527,,*,(...They really did that?!),
2528,,*,...There must be another way!,
2529,,Mio,Meow... This is the only way after what happened.,
2530,,*,(What happened? Turin or something else?),
2531,,*,"...I know what you went through, but this won't happen again. You have my word.",
2532,,Mio,...Now we cannot trust you.,
2533,,Mio,Meow... We've been waiting for too long. This might be our last chance.,
2534,,Mio,"Meow... And if you are not the chosen one, we'll send you back.",
2535,,*,After getting me out of the flame?... That's a well thought out idea I'd say.,
2536,,Mio,……,
2537,,,Mio isn't replying. Looks like she won't be saying anything any time soon.,
2538,,,"Most of the Hunters are hiding in the dark somewhere, and the brave ones approach a bit.",
2539,,,I can see hope and curiosity in their eyes.,
2540,,*,"(...Sorry, for I'm going to disappoint you)",
2541,,*,(Wait...? Rumpy is over there...),
2542,,,I recognized Rumpy from a distance. He 's watching me from a corner of this cave. None of the Hunters here are trying to approach him.,
2543,,*,"(No one approaches him... Because he's the ""Traitor""?)",
2544,,Mio,Meow... We're here.,
2545,Vision in the Flame,*,This is your sacred flame?,
2546,,,There's a fire lit in front of me. And its smoke goes to the surface via a hole in the ceiling. This might be what they've been preparing.,
2547,,Mio,Meow... The Sacred Flame comes from the tinder we've been keeping since the ancient time.,
2548,,Mio,It's a part of our god. She will respond if you look into the flame.,
2549,,*,(I don't think it's different from any other kind of fire I see in daily life...),
2550,,,I start to stare at the flame with doubt...,
2551,,,And the flame burns...,
2552,,*,(It's not reacting at all...),
2553,,,"After a while, I still don't sense anything different.",
2554,,*,"(I'm afraid I'll let them down, and I'll never earn their trust because of this)",
2555,,*,"(...Even though I do wish to get out of here, it's still not the best circumstances according to what I've seen here.",
2556,,,"By the time I decide to give up, I felt like something dangerous is staring at me.",
2557,,*,（……！？）,
2558,,,"I see a pair of eyes from the flame. The color of the eyes is indistinguishable from the flame, but rather more like a part of it.",
2559,,,As it stares at me just like a predator staring at its prey... I feel the chill even I'm actually standing by a bonfire.,
2560,,*,What's this!?,
2561,,Mio,Have you seen her?,
2562,,*,If the eyes are what you're expecting...,
2563,,Mio,"Meow... Concentrate, you will soon hear from her.",
2564,,*,But...,
2565,,,"The eyes I saw just keep staring at me, I cannot tell what ""she"" is trying to say... I doubt if anyone can tell what anyone wants to say only by looking at their eyes.",
2566,,*,……,
2567,,,I still tried to read something from the eyes...,
2568,,,"But before I do, it disappears from the flame.",
2569,,*,It disappears...,
2570,,Mio,What?,
2571,,*,...It disappears without saying or doing anything.,
2572,,Mio,……,
2573,,*,Is that a failure?,
2574,,Mio,"Meow... Maybe, it's what our god is trying to tell us.",
2575,,*,"So, we need to complete this anyway?",
2576,,Mio,"Meow... That's right, bathe yourself inside the flame. And you will receive the essence of our god after that.",
2577,,*,"(Does she mean the ability to control fire? Maybe for hunters, that will work, but Mio... I'm afraid she gets this power before this ritual)",
2578,,*,(But this is not the best time to tell her this...),
2579,,*,"(And honestly, depending on what I've seen, I'm afraid this ""god"" actually exists...)",
2580,,*,May I ask the name of your god?,
2581,,Mio,"Meow Azachil, the god of fire and hunt.",
2582,,*,"Alright, I hope this Meow Azachil can make all this worth it.",
2583,,Mio,"Meow, it's Azachil! There's no ""Meow"" in her name!",
2584,,,"As there are no other options, I take a step forward towards the bonfire...",
2585,,Hunters,Meow!? Meow!,
2586,,Mio,Meow!?,
2587,,*,"Huh? What's wrong, I haven't even stepped inside...",
2588,,,"Something is wrong, but it seems not because of this ritual. Rather it's something even more dangerous.",
2589,,*,I don't like this...,
2590,,Mio,Meow... You wait here!,
2591,,,"Before I can respond, Mio rushed out and attacked something.",
2592,,,"Rumpy took this chance and approaches me. But apparently, he changes his mind half-way and enters the battle.",
2593,,*,"What's he doing... Wait, it's...?",
2594,,Chaos Creature,Waaaaaaagh----!,
2595,,*,Chaos Creature!?,
2596,Ritual Finish...?,*,"I knew this would happen, but never expected this so soon.",
2597,,*,There's a lot of Chaos Creatures out there... None of them are of the types that were recorded. I'd better go and help them.,
2598,,*,But...,
2599,,,My hands are still tied...,
2600,,*,At least un-tie me before you leave...,
2601,,,"I can see Mio already rushing into the middle of the enemy group, and Rumpy comes along with her.",
2602,,,"Judging from her fighting style, this is a bad move, placing Mio at a disadvantage. But in order to cover the other Hunters, she has no choice.",
2603,,,"The Chaos Creatures seem to have high fire resistance, so melee is Mio's only option to deal actual damage to them.",
2604,,,"Even with the help of those other hunters, it's just a matter of time for them to lose this battle.",
2605,,,"...Even though, they still survived to stand here today. I could only imagine how much they've paid for this.",
2606,,*,Well...,
2607,,,The flame beside is still burning bright.,
2608,,,I finally decide to put my tied hands into the flame.,
2609,,,"As predicted, it hurts like hell. There's no mercy shown by this Sacred Flame.",
2610,,,"But, the ropes are burnt all of a sudden. It's way faster than I thought.",
2611,,*,...It must be Rumpy. So this is what he did that time.,
2612,,,But it's not the best time to check out my hands.,
2613,,*,Now... It's time to help Mio.,
2614,The Enemy of My Enemy,Turin,"The path is getting wider, we must be in the correct direction! But...",
2615,,Valeera,"It's noisy up ahead, what's happening?",
2616,,Ithil,Prepare yourselves... Someone is fighting.,
2617,,Iron Fist,...!!! Is that Senpai...?,
2618,,Aquaris,Shhh!!! We'd better stay low...,
2619,,Turin,"Never thought Aquaris would say something like this... Well, maybe it's because idiots could sense danger better than others.",
2620,,Aquaris,"... Turin, when did you learn to say something like this? It's really mean.",
2621,,Turin,From Senpai of course! He said there must be someone who points out the strange things in a team.,
2622,,Aquaris,That's not useful at all!,
2623,,Ithil,I can see that...,
2624,,Valeera,"Senpai, Rumpy... and the girl called Mio, are fighting against Chaos Creatures?",
2625,,Ithil,...Why is he walking into danger again?,
2626,,Iron Fist,We'll discuss that later... Saving him from the Chaos Creatures is the first priority!,
2627,,Ithil,"Fine, maybe this is our chance to get more intel.",
2628,,Aquaris,We've just fought our way out of that maze without any rest... Life is a struggle.,
2629,,Mio,You are...,
2630,,*,Finally! I knew you wouldn't leave me behind!,
2631,,Aquaris,"We'd love to, but unfortunately, we walked into this, that's all! And I don't think Iron Fist would want us to leave without you.",
2632,,Iron Fist,This isn't the best time! Prepare for battle!,
2633,,*,It's finally over...,
2634,,Iron Fist,(My arm hurts...),
2635,,*,Iron Fist...?,
2636,,Mio,Meow... Thanks for the help... But...,
2637,,Ithil,...Please explain.,
2638,,Ithil,Why would a hostage fight with his kidnapper?,
2639,,Mio,Meow... I didn't kidnap him! But he is...,
2640,,*,Maybe I can explain this...,
2641,,Ithil,...I see. Regardless how stupid you are to have your hands roasted. You must mean a lot to the Hunter's tribe.,
2642,,*,"Did you just call my sacrifice ""roasted""?",
2643,,Iron Fist,"Senpai, are you hurt? Let me check the wound...",
2644,,*,Well... It's not that serious.,
2645,,*,(I've still not gotten used to Iron Fist's change...),
2646,,Mio,Meow... Thanks for your help. But please leave now. We still have something to do.,
2647,,Ithil,"Oh, you look soooo grateful.",
2648,,*,(Coughs with intend),
2649,,*,"(Ithil... I believe this is a nice chance for us to earn their trust, maybe...)",
2650,,Ithil,"(Exactly, this is worth a shot)",
2651,,*,(Why so decisive this time? Are you planning to leave me alone here again?),
2652,,Ithil,"(Why would I? This is actually the best chance we have now to get more intel. Besides, I cannot take out all these Hunters alone.)",
2653,,*,(So you did think about leaving me here again...),
2654,,*,"Well, Mio... Since we've proved our non-hostility. Can we at least talk a little bit?",
2655,,Mio,Meow... Follow me.,
2656,,*,(Where's Rumpy again?...),
2657,Wisdom in Surviving,,"We left the battlefield with Mio. On the way, I can only see tired-look from the Hunters.",
2658,,,"If they're in the forest, they should be able to live a lot better than this.",
2659,,,"Iron Fist and Aquaris look very nervous, but Ithil, Valeera, and Turin are just looking around----",
2660,,Valeera,This is amazing...,
2661,,*,What?,
2662,,Valeera,The structure of this cave... I can't believe it was built by the Hunters.,
2663,,*,This is a big cave. But I think anyone can dig one if he works hard at it.,
2664,,Valeera,"No, it's not as easy as you think... Watch closely. The caves for the Hunters to rest and play is higher than others, there's even canals for those caves.",
2665,,Valeera,"It will not only supply their daily need of water, but also prevents the gas of the volcano from harming them.",
2666,,Ithil,"And the bonfire over there, the hold above it should be connected to the surface.",
2667,,*,"Oh, it's the bonfire for their rituals...",
2668,,Ithil,So this is the reason the airflow works differently.,
2669,,Ithil,I thought there couldn't be a way to reverse the airflow...,
2670,,Ithil,If they could properly use the bonfire and control the airflow. No one will be able to get out of that maze without needing guidance.,
2671,,*,What does that mean?,
2672,,Ithil,It means we might never find you.,
2673,,*,Sounds scary...,
2674,,Iron Fist,This is the new home for the Hunters...,
2675,,Iron Fist,"But, I think they're supposed to be in forests? Even the trees here are burnt, they could find somewhere else...",
2676,,Iron Fist,Why they still stay here?,
2677,,Aquaris,"Maybe this place means a lot to them? After all, they were born here~",
2678,,*,……,
2679,,,"Since they will have to face the Chaos threat in this place, this isn't a solid explanation.",
2680,,*,I think we will soon find out...,
2681,,Mio,"Meow... Come in, please.",
2682,Conversation,,Mio leads us to a big cave. It looks like some place the Hunters would use to hold meetings.,
2683,,Mio,"What, do you want?",
2684,,*,"(Before we actually start talking, there's one more thing I need to make sure...)",
2685,,*,What about the ritual? I thought there is a final step.,
2686,,Mio,You've completed that yourself.,
2687,,*,What's the result?,
2688,,,Mio seems confused when she looks at my hands.,
2689,,Mio,Meow... I don't know.,
2690,,*,What?,
2691,,Mio,Meow... This never happened before. The Sacred Flame did enter your body... But I cannot feel the divine power...,
2692,,*,Maybe I should throw my entire body into the flame?,
2693,,Mio,"Meow... The ritual, can only be done once.",
2694,,*,So... I'm not the chosen one?,
2695,,Mio,……,
2696,,,Mio keeps her mouth shut... Maybe I've let her down.,
2697,,,I tried to convince myself that their expectation is misplaced... But I still want to help them...,
2698,,Aquaris,"Forget about that! At least we've won, right? Chaos won't be a big threat as long as we work together.",
2699,,*,Judging from what I've seen... The Hunters are about to reach their limits. Most of them won't be able to survive the next attack if you fight alone.,
2700,,Mio,……,
2701,,Mio,Meow... We can work together.,
2702,,*,"(Finally, we've made some progress)",
2703,,Mio,But we still can't forgive you!,
2704,,,Mio still shows great hostility towards Turin.,
2705,,Turin,...,
2706,,*,(...There's still a long way to go),
2707,,*,"Since we've reached an agreement, I think it's necessary to share our information... As you know, we're here for something.",
2708,,Valeera,"According to the legend, it should be called ""The eye of Vulcan""...",
2709,,Mio,"Meow... We won't give it to you!... Besides, we don't own it anymore.",
2710,,*,(I knew it won't be this easy to get it. But...),
2711,,*,What do you mean you don't have it anymore?,
2712,,Mio,……,
2713,,,Mio starts to tell us about what happened during the war against Chaos.,
2714,The Wrath of God,,"The 59th Year of Chaos Calendar, Volcano Hecrum",
2715,,Hunter,Meow…,
2716,,Mio,"Meow... Don't worry, those evil creatures are gone.",
2717,,Mio,But there were still too many of us who got captured by their tools.,
2718,,Mio,"Meow... But at least, we're here. The forest is here. Our god is with us.",
2719,,Mio,The great Azachil... Please tell us what to do.,
2720,,Hunter,Meow...! Meow!,
2721,,Mio,Meow?!,
2722,,？？？,Jackpot...,
2723,,,"A giant figure appeared in front of Mio, and anyone can smell evil presence from it even from a distance.",
2724,,,It's one of them...,
2725,,？？？,Those creepy cats have troublesome powers.,
2726,,？？？,But they won't be so annoying as long as I take this away from them.,
2727,,Magma Demon,And I will become the strongest...,
2728,,Mio,You will never...!!!,
2729,,Magma Demon,Weaklings... You don't deserve this power.,
2730,,Magma Demon,"This crystal, and the power of this volcano will both be mine!",
2731,,Mio,(I need to warn everyone about this...),
2732,,Mio,Everyone... Run! It's...,
2733,,,"The Holy mountain, volcano Hecrum--- which has already protected Redridge Forest and Hunter's Tribe for centuries--- erupts.",
2734,,,It's the wrath of god--- that was what everyone thought after the lava burns out the entire forest.,
2735,,,"The lava doesn't discriminate. It burns everything, whether it's living creature or creatures of Chaos. Only Mio and the rest of Hunter's Tribe barely survived by hiding themselves underground.",
2736,,,After the eruption is over. There was no Redridge Forest left. There is only a Wasteland of Foehn.,
2737,,,As Hecrum still erupts occasionally after that. Mio and her tribe believes this is a sign of their god. So they decided to stay.,
2738,,,"Until the day they can get the ""The eye of Vulcan"" back, and calm their god's anger.",
2739,Unite,Everyone,……,
2740,,,"After hearing the story, no one feels like saying anything",
2741,,,"Compared to what happened on this land, the danger on campus is just too tiny. And we finally come to understand what Ithil tried to warn us.",
2742,,,"And finally, someone breaks the silence.",
2743,,Valeera,Magma Demon... Is that...,
2744,,Ithil,"If my memory still serves me right, the Legion of Chaos stopped their attack after Dire captures Jacob.",
2745,,Ithil,But they launched another invasion 10 years before the eruption of volcano Hecrum.,
2746,,Turin,And that's also the reason we deployed the Servant controlling device.,
2747,,,Turin gradually lowers her voice.,
2748,,Mio,……,
2749,,Ithil,"...But after the eruption in your story. The Legion of Chaos stopped their attack again. We thought it was a coincidence, but maybe it's caused by that Magma Demon.",
2750,,*,But... I thought the leader of the Legion of Chaos was Dire.,
2751,,Ithil,I'm afraid it's because Dire cannot gain full control of his legion when he was inside Jacob's body.,
2752,,Ithil,Due to the fact that Chaos Creatures can become stronger by consuming other Chaos Creatures. Magma Demon probably took command during Dire's absence.,
2753,,*,That's a horrible story...,
2754,,Valeera,And Magma Demon didn't continue the attack on Yume Academy so that he can safely consume the power of this volcano with the antique.,
2755,,Ithil,Maybe this is also the reason we could win this war,
2756,,Turin,"But the fact is, the Hunters here are suffering while we are at peace.",
2757,,*,"This means, that Magma Demon is the cause of all these tragedies.",
2758,,,"Before Turin starts to blame herself again, Aquaris interrupts the conversation.",
2759,,Aquaris,"Wait... According to the story, that Magma Demon kept growing for the past century! Do we really have to defeat that monster?",
2760,,*,"But if we leave it here, we're letting the Hunters suffer more. And that creature might cause bigger problems when it comes out willingly.",
2761,,Aquaris,"Uh... Iron Fist, why don't you say something?",
2762,,Iron Fist,I... I agree with Senpai.,
2763,,,Iron Fist seems very sad when she says that.,
2764,,*,（……）,
2765,,Aquaris,"Damn...! I also feel sad about these Hunters here... But.......... Fine, count me in.",
2766,,Ithil,"So, what does Magma Demon look like?",
2767,,Mio,Meow... It's a giant monster covered with corneous skin...,
2768,,Mio,But I have no idea if it has changed its appearance. We've never seen him ever since...,
2769,,Ithil,"So, we still need to check what it looks like...",
2770,,*,But it's already very late tonight. We'd better go tomorrow.,
2771,,*,"Mio, can you arrange a cave for us to rest?",
2772,,Mio,Meow... Will do.,
2773,,,"After the discussion is over, we leave the hall and start the preparation.",
2774,,Rumpy,……,
2775,,,"When we get out, I see Rumpy near the entrance. He still looks annoying as usual.",
2776,,*,(That's what you're planning about?),
2777,,Ithil,"But, we still don't know what's the relationship between him and Mio.",
2778,,*,... I'm still trying to find out.,
2779,,*,At least he's not an enemy.,
2780,,Ithil,Okay.,
2781,,Ithil,But I still think it's necessary to remind you that our primary objective is that antique.,
2782,,Ithil,"And if Mio refuses to give us that antique, we will work hard for nothing.",
2783,,*,...Don't worry.,
2784,,Ithil,……,
2785,Uncovered Secret,,Late at night... Inside my tent---,
2786,,*,(Sigh)... This is a long day. Guess I can finally relax without Rumpy.,
2787,,*,……,
2788,,*,My hands still hurt... What on Earth were those eyes I saw during the ritual?,
2789,,*,The relationship between Mio and Rumpy... And that Chaos Creature known as Magma Demon...,
2790,,*,There's so many mysteries left for us to discover... How can I even have a good sleep with so many questions inside my head?,
2791,,Iron Fist,Senpai...? May I come in?,
2792,,*,"Is it Iron Fist? Come in, please.",
2793,,Iron Fist,"Senpai, are your hands alright? I got you some ointment for the burn...",
2794,,*,"Oh... Thank you, it's not that bad.",
2795,,Iron Fist,... Let me just apply that on your hands.,
2796,,*,……,
2797,,Iron Fist,……,
2798,,,Iron Fist gently applied the ointment on my hands. The touch of her hands relieves me from the pain.,
2799,,,...Hope I can hold her hand forever.,
2800,,Iron Fist,Uh... Anything wrong?... Senpai?,
2801,,*,Huh?,
2802,,,"Before I can realize, I've already been holding Iron Fist's prosthetic arm for a while.",
2803,,*,………………………………,
2804,,*,(What am I doing!?),
2805,,,I think it's necessary to save us from the embarrassment...,
2806,,*,By the way... Iron Fist... It seems your prosthetic arm isn't working that fine during the last battle...,
2807,,Iron Fist,Yes... But I'm fine now.,
2808,,,"According to KongMing, ""If Iron Fist joins a battle that is too intensive, her physical condition might deteriorate...""",
2809,,*,I know that you might still insist on fighting with us but...,
2810,,*,You should stay away from the following battles.,
2811,,*,I won't forgive myself for not being able to stop you if anything bad happens.,
2812,,Iron Fist,…………,
2813,,,Iron Fist lowers her head... I think she's trying to hide her face from me.,
2814,,,"After a while, she faces me with relief.",
2815,,Iron Fist,"Okay, I'll stand aside... Please don't worry about me.",
2816,,*,That will be fine...,
2817,,,I try to ignore the tears on her face.,
2818,,Iron Fist,"Okay... Senpai, good night.",
2819,,*,"I will, so do you.",
2820,,,Iron Fist leaves my tent without saying anything.,
2821,,Iron Fist,（…………）,
2822,,Iron Fist,(As it turns out... I'm still dead weight to you...),
2823,,,Iron Fist sighs when she looks at her prosthetic arm.,
2824,Secret Plan,,At the same time,
2825,,？？？,Magma Demon! Your minions are wiped out and the enemies are coming! You're sitting ducks here!,
2826,,Magma Demon,Just consider that some expendable assets got expended.,
2827,,Magma Demon,That means nothing to me.,
2828,,？？？,"If you didn't take control of most of my legion, we'd have already won this war!",
2829,,？？？,And yet you've done nothing!,
2830,,？？？,"Arrogant fool... Some day, you will reap it.",
2831,,？？？,Ahhhhhhh----!,
2832,,Magma Demon,"Mind your next word very carefully, Dire. In the current state you're in, you don't even deserve to be my food. You are alive only because I want to see you suffer.",
2833,,Dire,(Damn... You will pay for this),
2834,,Magma Demon,"If you are so afraid of them. Why don't you go check it out yourself? But if even you can survive from them, they are no threat to me.",
2835,,Dire,………………,
2836,,Magma Demon,"Now get out of my sight, you sniveling fool.",
2837,,Dire,(This fool is totally unreasonable...),
2838,,Dire,"(But if I can consume all those invaders, maybe I'll be able to rise again)",
2839,,Dire,"(I can still remember that one of them is... Let's start with her, hehehe...)",
2840,FIRE!,*,(It's... Again!),
2841,,*,(Just like the last dream...!),
2842,,,A black space... A dim light in this space... All the same.,
2843,,,Even the feeling for me to be in this space hasn't changed a bit.,
2844,,*,(How could this happen again...),
2845,,*,(This doesn't make sense at all...),
2846,,*,(Including the part that knowing myself being in a dream...),
2847,,*,(But still... First things first is to wake up...),
2848,,*,(Last time I was awakened by some strange light...),
2849,,,When I'm thinking of a way to wake myself up... I was interrupted by a sudden pain.,
2850,,*,"(It hurts... No, it burns...! What's going on...)!",
2851,,,The light spot in space suddenly starts to sparkle more intensively... And I feel a painful burning sensation in my body.,
2852,,*,(Fire...!?),
2853,,,"The fire formed by the light spots keeps spreading... And then, it starts to burn the entire space. With me inside of it. And inside the fire, I see something familiar... That EYE.",
2854,,*,………………………………,
2855,,*,That's... Really a bad dream...,
2856,,*,Is that... Because of the ritual?,
2857,,,There are still nothing that changed on my hands.,
2858,,*,What's going on...?,
2859,Temporary Peace,*,I still can't sleep well... Is it because of the climate?,
2860,,*,I hope this journey will end soon...,
2861,,*,Uh... What time is it now?,
2862,,,"Since we're inside a cave, we can't tell what time it is without sunlight. But the Hunters are all awake so I assume it's morning.",
2863,,*,It's noisy... What are they doing?,
2864,,Hunter Baby,Meow~! Meow!!,
2865,,Turin,Haha~ Have you seen this before?,
2866,,Hunter Baby,Meow Meow~!,
2867,,,"Outside the tent, Turin is surrounded by some Hunters. They are playing.",
2868,,,Turin releases beams from her fingers to form a light spot on the wall. And the Hunters are trying to catch it.,
2869,,Turin,Wow~ Nice try! What about this one?,
2870,,,Turin starts to release beams from all 10 of her fingers...,
2871,,,"Obviously, this is beyond the Hunters' capability.",
2872,,Turin,Yay~ I won!,
2873,,,"I'd rather call that ""Cheat to win""...",
2874,,*,Morning.,
2875,,,"I step closer once their ""game"" is over.",
2876,,Turin,"Hi, Senpai! Good morning!",
2877,,*,You were...?,
2878,,Turin,Oh... I just happened to see these Hunters playing when I woke up...,
2879,,Turin,"I tried not to interrupt them... But they didn't seem like letting me leave without playing, so I had to join them.",
2880,,*,Looks like you were having some fun.,
2881,,Turin,……,
2882,,Turin,I don't deserve this...,
2883,,Turin,And those Hunters don't know what I've done to their kins.,
2884,,,Turin looks sorry when watching the Hunters sleeping on the ground.,
2885,,Turin,"What I have done, made them suffer for the past century.",
2886,,*,……,
2887,,Turin,"Maybe in a few years, they would forget about their hatred, their culture... They might be killed by Chaos...",
2888,,Turin,I feel lucky that we're able to get here earlier than that... So there might be a chance for me to find my redemption.,
2889,,Turin,This might be a selfish thought... But I would want to correct my mistake by helping these Hunters before it's too late. Whether they will forgive me or not.,
2890,,*,"This isn't selfish, none of us would want these Hunters to suffer any longer. Mio and her tribe will finally accept your apology.",
2891,,Turin,Thank you...,
2892,,*,"Well, everyone is awake now.",
2893,Back to the Grid,Aquaris,HEY!!! Good morning~,
2894,,Ithil,You woke up earlier than I thought.,
2895,,Turin,AI doesn't actually need to sleep!,
2896,,*,(And I didn't have a good sleep...),
2897,,Iron Fist,……,
2898,,Valeera,"Alright... It's a big day, I hope everyone's ready~",
2899,,Everyone,Yeah~!,
2900,,*,So... Where's Mio? She's supposed to lead the way.,
2901,,Mio,Meow... Good Morning.,
2902,,,Mio walks out from the shadow of the corner of this cave... But I thought she lives in another side of it.,
2903,,Mio,"Meow... It's dangerous to get to the crater, you people better watch out.",
2904,,,"Maybe it's just a misconception, but Mio doesn't look that hostile to Turin today.",
2905,,*,"Thanks, we've prepared for that.",
2906,,Mio,Meow... Let's go then.,
2907,,,"Mio leads the way for us, and the maze means nothing to her as she takes each forked path without any hesitation.",
2908,,*,(But I'm still worried about Iron Fist...),
2909,,,Iron Fist brings up the rear... She's not joining our conversation.,
2910,,,"I must have disappointed her yesterday. But it must be done in order to keep her safe... Hopefully, she can understand why I said that... I have a promise to keep... I must bring everyone back alive.",
2911,,,"After walking for several minutes, we can see some light up ahead.",
2912,,Mio,Meow... We are about to reach the surface.,
2913,,*,Surface?,
2914,,Mio,Meow... The rest path to the crater is on the surface.,
2915,,Aquaris,I thought we can get there straightly from the passage.,
2916,,Valeera,"Uh... If they design the passage like that, it will kill them when the volcano erupts.",
2917,,Valeera,"Even if the lava doesn't flow in, its poisonous gas will.",
2918,,Aquaris,I see... Thank god they didn't dig a tunnel straight towards the crater. But it's still good to breathe some fresh air on the surface!,
2919,,Mio,Meow... This is the exit.,
2920,,Iron Fist,It's....,
2921,,,"With Mio's help, we leave the cave and get to the surface...",
2922,,,And what we encounter is beyond our prediction...,
2923,,Aquaris,……,
2924,Volcanic Ash,,The air quality is horrible. Even the sunlight is blocked by the volcanic ash here.,
2925,,,Even our clothes might be colored black because of the ash here.,
2926,,Aquaris,(Coughs)... What the hell?!,
2927,,Ithil,"I think we've reached the destination... Otherwise, there won't be so much volcanic ash in the air.",
2928,,Turin,"...Warning, air pollution reached lethal level.",
2929,,*,"(Coughs)... Is it because of the eruption? Screw fighting, we will die by this in an instant...!",
2930,,Valeera,Don't panic! I saw this coming! My new spell will solve this...,
2931,,Valeera,"I'll create three membranes around our heads, and stop the toxic gas from entering our lungs with them.",
2932,,Valeera,"After the air passes the filter of these membranes, we can get fresh air!",
2933,,Valeera,"Let's call it ""Water Membrane""!",
2934,,*,"Oh! I can breathe fresh air now! Nice work, Valeera!",
2935,,Mio,"Meow!!!! What's this, get the water away from me! I'm going to die!",
2936,,*,Mio!? Calm down! Try to inhale and exhale! Now Inhale...,
2937,,Mio,Meow? (Breathing)...,
2938,,*,See? It won't drown you.,
2939,,Mio,…………………………,
2940,,,Mio turns away from us and starts to trim her hair... Maybe in order to make herself not look embarrassed.,
2941,,,...Just like a cat.,
2942,,*,But... Why is it getting dark...,
2943,,Valeera,Well... It's because the water gets dirty. I need to create several more water membranes to prevent this from happening again...,
2944,,Valeera,That's troublesome.,
2945,,Aquaris,"Uh... Valeera, can I make a suggestion?",
2946,,Valeera,What's that?,
2947,,Aquaris,Maybe you can make the spell cover my entire body? I'm getting dirty because of the ash...,
2948,,Valeera,That's a waste of my mana! I won't do that!,
2949,,Aquaris,That's bad news... I can even feel the dirt on my skin... Maybe I should spend a day in the bathroom once this is over.,
2950,,*,"By the way, Valeera, I guess you will need to cast that spell one more time...",
2951,,,I've noticed the little Hunter trying to follow us.,
2952,,Valeera,"Don't worry, I've already noticed him.",
2953,,*,Alright... Let's go.,
2954,,,After making sure everyone can breathe freely... We start to study the terrain.,
2955,,,The rocks we are stepping on were once lava. Hope they won't start flowing again.,
2956,,,We cannot sense any life nearby. It's like hell.,
2957,,,And the cause of all this---Volcano Hecrum--- is still spilling lava out even now.,
2958,,*,So... This is it?,
2959,,Mio,Meow... That's right.,
2960,,Iron Fist,It's horrible...,
2961,,Valeera,The mountain... Was it this big...?,
2962,,Turin,I've got movement...,
2963,,Ithil,It's Chaos Creatures. They're closing in!,
2964,,Aquaris,Perfect... Just when I can use some sandbags to release my anger!,
2965,,Valeera,Protect your water membrane during the fight!,
2966,,*,"Iron Fist, you can watch our back.",
2967,,Iron Fist,...Okay.,
2968,,*,……,
2969,,Dire,(Perfect... Now it's my chance!),
2970,,Dire,(I can engage once they start fighting against Magma Demon... Hehe),
2971,,Ithil,（……？）,
2972,,Ithil,(Is something over there?),
2973,One step in Hell,Ithil,Wait...,
2974,,*,Why?,
2975,,Ithil,... I sense Chaos nearby.,
2976,,*,I don't feel anything wrong since there are Chaos Creatures all over the place.,
2977,,Ithil,"But I still feel strange, just like how I've once encountered the creature with this smell.",
2978,,Ithil,Maybe I just worried too much.,
2979,,Iron Fist,……,
2980,,*,"Iron Fist, is there anything wrong?",
2981,,Iron Fist,"No... Don't worry, I just feel a little bit sick... It might because of the ash around here.",
2982,,*,I see... Just don't be too strict to yourself.,
2983,,Iron Fist,...Okay.,
2984,,Aquaris,I've got a question... May I ask now?,
2985,,*,Please don't...,
2986,,Aquaris,Well... Since we're standing very next to the crater... What if... What if there's an eruption coming soon? Can we... even make it out of here alive?,
2987,,*,……,
2988,,,I cannot help to look at the magmatic rock I'm stepping on.,
2989,,,Maybe we're currently stepping on the corps of the last visitors.,
2990,,*,I don't think our luck is that bad.,
2991,,,But my words cannot even convince myself.,
2992,,Valeera,Don't worry.,
2993,,Valeera,"According to history, foehn only happens once every few weeks, and the eruption of this mountain is the only cause of the foehn.",
2994,,Valeera,"It's only been several days since the last foehn, so it won't be happening anytime soon.",
2995,,Valeera,"Plus, if the volcano is about to erupt, the Hunters and Ithil will be able to tell us before it actually happens...",
2996,,*,That's the most comforting word I've heard today...,
2997,,Valeera,"But, this is only based on the pattern in the past.",
2998,,Valeera,If that Magma Demon has the ability to cause Volcano eruption...,
2999,,*,Stop! Have you ever heard of Murphy's law? It will probably come true if you keep talking like this!,
3000,,Ithil,We've come this far. Are you thinking of quitting now?,
3001,,*,...Of course not. I've prepared for this when I made the decision to come with you.,
3002,,Ithil,Huh... Looks like I bothered too much.,
3003,,Ithil,...Then show me your determination.,
3004,,,"So we proceed while avoiding the floating lava. And soon, we've reached the crater.",
3005,Tyrant of Lava,,"There's still black smoke coming out from the crater, and the lava keeps flowing out.",
3006,,,Just like they're running away from the tyrant who rules the volcano.,
3007,,Mio,Magma Demon...,
3008,,Everyone,……,
3009,,Aquaris,…………………………,
3010,,Aquaris,Well...,
3011,,,Aquaris is trying to say something.,
3012,,Aquaris,Maybe it's a good chance for us to run away?,
3013,,*,……,
3014,,,"To be honest, I'm not going to blame her...",
3015,,,As the creature is way too enormous. Its body has almost covered the entire crater.,
3016,,,Its keratinized skin clings to the inner side of the volcano. As if it has become a part of the volcano... And the volcano has become a part of it.,
3017,,*,"I knew it was big, but I never thought it could be this big!?",
3018,,Ithil,"No one could ignore a monster of this size during a war, but I never knew this one.",
3019,,*,So...,
3020,,Ithil,I'm afraid it grows itself this big with the help of that antique.,
3021,,Mio,Meow... This is a blasphemy to our god!,
3022,,*,Am I learning what an antique can do or what a swiss army knife can do...?,
3023,,Valeera,It grows...? Maybe...,
3024,,,A mass of lava is tossed towards us when we are still shocked by the size of Magma Demon.,
3025,,Iron Fist,Senpai!,
3026,,Valeera & Ithil,Watch out!,
3027,,,"Before I can react, Valeera has deployed a barrier with her magic and Ithil has moved everyone to a safer place.",
3028,,*,What is this...,
3029,,,"The place we once stood is now covered by lava, Valeera's spell successfully stopped the lava from spilling around.",
3030,,,Judging from the weight and its temperature... This attack might be more powerful than a small meteorite. I doubt if anyone can survive from this.,
3031,,Magma Demon,Tch... Maybe you can bring me some fun.,
3032,,,The Chaos Creature opens its ugly mouth and starts to speak.,
3033,,Magma Demon,"So you're the ""enemy"" who Dire mentioned. Since you're here, I take it Dire is dead.",
3034,,,Dire...? Why did the monster mentioned him? Is he even involved in this?,
3035,,Magma Demon,"But, this is what I've always been expecting: a toy that can bring me more fun... You should know if you don't dodge my last strike, you can at least have a quick death.",
3036,,Magma Demon,"Now, you have earned your chance to entertain me with your pain and despair! And after that, I will spill your guts all over!",
3037,,,...There is no time to think of any other things. And I just know the only thing I should do now.,
3038,,Ithil,What do you say? We might make it out alive if we escape now.,
3039,,*,……,
3040,,*,"No, we're not escaping. There's no way we can run away from it forever. At least right now, it's not expecting this and has let its guard down... Maybe we can even find his weak point or clues regarding the antique.",
3041,,Ithil,"...Good choice, I will try to attract its attention.",
3042,,*,"Turin, try to scan its weakness and any energy reading from the antique while you're at it!",
3043,,Turin,Roger!,
3044,,*,"Valeera, please protect us.",
3045,,Valeera,I got this!,
3046,,*,"Aquaris, come and support Ithil with me.",
3047,,Aquaris,...It's horrible... But I will try my best...!,
3048,,*,"Mio... I understand that you still don't trust us, but I want you to know that we trust you... I hope you can take out the rest of the Chaos Creatures that are a threat.",
3049,,Mio,"Meow... Okay, I got your back.",
3050,,,I finally noticed the tiny figure hiding in the shadows once again. Somehow I believe he's involved in all this.,
3051,,,"...You've foreseen this, right?",
3052,,*,"And... Iron Fist, stay...",
3053,,Iron Fist,"Okay, I will.",
3054,,*,Thanks... Sorry.,
3055,,*,Now... Let's go!,
3056,,Everyone,Okay!,
3057,,Magma Demon,Hahaha! Come here! I'll pinch you like little fleas.,
3058,,*,"(Calm down... Its skin can't be unbreakable, I shall trust my friends more...!)",
3059,,Magma Demon,Hahaha! Nice! It's a waste for me to kill you...,
3060,,Magma Demon,You have the opportunity to be a part of me!... It's been a long time since I last ate a human.,
3061,,*,(Damn... Our attacks did nothing to him),

3067,,Iron Fist,W-What's going on?,
3068,,Iron Fist,Where am I...? I'm supposed to be at the crater.,
3069,,Iron Fist,Senpai? Anyone here?,
3070,,Ithil,……,
3071,,Iron Fist,Ithil?,
3072,,Ithil,Iron Fist... You are so disappointing.,
3073,,Iron Fist,！？,
3074,,Ithil,You have no talent at all. No one can make you go any further.,
3075,,Ithil,Do you know how annoying you are when you come to ask me to train you? It's just a waste of my time.,
3076,,Iron Fist,Really...? You didn't say that before...,
3077,,KongMing,Iron Fist...,
3078,,Iron Fist,KongMing!,
3079,,KongMing,"Stop, don't come any closer.",
3080,,Iron Fist,KongMing... Why?,
3081,,KongMing,I've never made any mistake before... Until you showed up...,
3082,,KongMing,You're the biggest mistake I've ever made... I should have known that you were the cause of all the Chaos on campus. I even wasted this prosthetic arm on you...,
3083,,KongMing,I should convince Raphael to leave you to die in the forest... So things could be a lot better...,
3084,,Iron Fist,…………,
3085,,Aquaris,Iron Fist...,
3086,,Iron Fist,Aquaris... Do you hate me too?,
3087,,Aquaris,"Iron Fist... You always look so innocent... You are pretending to look like this so you can win over everyone's sympathy, don't you?",
3088,,Aquaris,"KongMing, Senpai... With all of them around you, you must be so happy~",
3089,,Aquaris,"Thanks to you, there's no way for me to ever show my sadness even for once. Just because I'm standing next to you...",
3090,,Aquaris,"But I do have my own feelings, I wish I could act like a complete person like everyone else!... But as long as you exist, I'm just nobody.",
3091,,Aquaris,"...I could only become a fool, a joker, making you irreplaceable. You must be very happy about this.",
3092,,Aquaris,Iron Fist... I hate you.,
3093,,Iron Fist,Sorry... I'm sorry...,
3094,,*,Iron Fist...,
3095,,Iron Fist,Senpai... Not you... Stop it...,
3096,,*,"I mean really, Iron Fist, stop trying to get close to me.",
3097,,Iron Fist,No... No...,
3098,,*,You are just one of the thousands of students on campus. What makes you believe you stand out from the rest?,
3099,,Iron Fist,Stop it...,
3100,,*,Once again... You start to mop... I've grown tired of this... Everyone's tired of this!,
3101,,Iron Fist,"I know... I know that... Senpai, please stop it...",
3102,,*,Because you are a failure.,
3103,,Iron Fist,Failure...?,
3104,,？？？,Iron Fist... Are you trying to escape by yourself...!?,
3105,,Iron Fist,Uh... Blood?... And you are...,
3106,,Iron Fist,My hand...!!!!,
3107,,Dire,"(Hehe... Your despair is delicious... Now allow me to consume your spirit, and take over your body... You will become my perfect puppet...!)",
3108,,Dire,(Your power... Your essence... And the Chaos inside you... They are all mine...!),
3109,Retreat,,Valeera was the first to notice Iron Fist being a little different.,
3110,,Valeera,"...!? Everyone, I don't think Iron Fist is looking any good!",
3111,,*,What!?,
3112,,,I give some attention to my back...,
3113,,,"And I see Iron Fist on the ground, struggling in pain.",
3114,,*,(Why...!? She wasn't involved in our battle... Did anything went wrong?),
3115,,Ithil,"Don't hesitate because of this, do what you need to do.",
3116,,*,...That's right. We cannot stay here forever.,
3117,,*,Everyone... Prepare to retreat!,
3118,,Magma Demon,"Haha, now you are trying to run away? You are just like the scattering flies to me... I won't let you succeed.",
3119,,,"Magma Demon starts to trample the ground. The impact that he made is even stronger than an earthquake, making it hard for us to maintain balance. And...",
3120,,Aquaris,The ground is getting torn apart!? And the lava underneath is flooding out...,
3121,,Ithil,"Valeera and Turin, cover us!",
3122,,Turin,No problem... The lava means nothing to me.,
3123,,Valeera,Make haste. This place would collapse anytime!,
3124,,Ithil,Hang on!,
3125,,Aquaris,Wait... What?,
3126,,,"Ithil takes... She grabs Aquaris and leaves swiftly... Aquaris is not our problem now, but...",
3127,,*,Iron Fist...! I'm coming for you...,
3128,,,I'm trying my best to get to Iron Fist as fast as I can... But...,
3129,,Valeera,Iron Fist's position is too far! You will not be able to make it!,
3130,,*,I know...,
3131,,,But this fact doesn't stop me from reaching Iron Fist... I didn't realize she is under such pain until I reach her and look closely at her face.,
3132,,*,……,
3133,,,"As Valeera said, it's already too late for me to return as the ground nearby is torn apart and covered with lava.",
3134,,Valeera,Damn... It's too late!,
3135,,Turin,Let me go and...!,
3136,,*,Don't bother... I've got help.,
3137,,,"Of course... This is the reason I didn't let Mio engage with us, as it's a part of the plan. Not only because I trust her...",
3138,,*,Mio...!,
3139,,,And Mio doesn't fail me. She grabbed me and Iron Fist to her with her chains.,
3140,,Mio,Meow...!!,
3141,,,"I try my best to jump high... With Mio's help, I can easily make it across this lava...",
3142,,Turin,S-senpai... Are you alright...,
3143,,*,Not dead yet...,
3144,,Valeera,That was scary...,
3145,,*,"Mio, thanks a lot. I knew I can count on you.",
3146,,Mio,Meow...,
3147,,Ithil,"Let's talk about this later, now is the time to run for our lives.",
3148,,Magma Demon,Insects...! You can't run forever!!! I will find you... And CRUSH you!!!,
3149,,Magma Demon,…………,
3150,,Magma Demon,……………………,
3151,,Magma Demon,Hahaha!,
3152,,Magma Demon,"I recognized those humans... They are from that ""Yume"" or something a hundred years ago.",
3153,,Magma Demon,"...Fine. Since the life in this volcano gets old. I shall burn your forest and take your land... Afterward, it will become my next home. Hahahaha!!!!",
3154,Misery Loves Company,Aquaris,(Gasp)... I can't believe we made it...,
3155,,Ithil,And now it's your chance to let go.,
3156,,Aquaris,Huh... Oh! Sorry!,
3157,,,Aquaris finally remembers the fact that she is still hanging on Ithil.,
3158,,Aquaris,(Why's that?... My heart is beating so fast... Was it because of the battle or Ithil...?),
3159,,Valeera,Looks like everyone's fine... Except...,
3160,,*,Except Iron Fist is unconscious.,
3161,,Turin,Let me run a check on her.,
3162,,,"After getting Iron Fist on bed, Turin touches her and starts to run a diagnosis.",
3163,,Turin,How can it be...,
3164,,*,What happened?,
3165,,Turin,There is energy reading of the Chaos inside her body...,
3166,,*,……！？,
3167,,Ithil,It must be Dire... That must also be the reason why I felt strange when we were at the crater. Damn... I should have noticed that sooner.,
3168,,Turin,It's not only Dire... There's something else... All I can tell you is that it's not alive.,
3169,,*,…………,
3170,,Ithil,"You don't seem surprised. You must have known this, right?",
3171,,*,...Not much. And I didn't tell you just in case Iron Fist would take it the wrong way.,
3172,,Ithil,"...Whatever. Our current priority is to save her. Turin, any ideas?",
3173,,Turin,"I also scanned her prosthetic arm... The modification just updated its hardware, but the core is still Sivney's version.",
3174,,Turin,I assume the prosthetic arm has been suppressing the unknown Chaos power inside Iron Fist. And the recent regular battles pushed it to the limit...,
3175,,Turin,"I'm afraid the Dire's attack caused this coma. Even the prosthetic arm is still functional, the Chaos inside her has already exceeded the limit of the arm. And because of that, Dire will gradually take over Iron Fist's body...",
3176,,*,So... Any ideas?,
3177,,Turin,"...I don't know. This arm is not my design, and I don't have the power to get Chaos out of a person's body.",
3178,,Ithil,...What about getting back on campus?,
3179,,*,...Maybe it's too late...,
3180,,Rumpy,Meow! Meow Meow!!! Meow!!!!!,
3181,,*,Rumpy...!?,
3182,,Mio,………………,
3183,,,Mio doesn't look good after hearing this. And all the Hunters in the cave seems to be in panic... I don't think it's good news.,
3184,,*,"Mio, what's going on?",
3185,,Mio,Meow... The volcano is going to erupt.,
3186,Spread up,*,I thought the next eruption will happen after several weeks.,
3187,,Valeera,That's just a pattern in the past. But now I've known the reason behind the regular eruption.,
3188,,*,So...?,
3189,,Valeera,"During the war against Chaos, Magma demon robbed the antique from Hunter's tribe and caused the first eruption which burnt up the forest.",
3190,,Valeera,"Afterward, Magma Demon has been inside the crater and kept growing by absorbing the volcano's power.",
3191,,Valeera,"As its size kept growing, the crater is no longer big enough. Thus, blocking the only exit for the heat of the volcano... And when the heat reaches a certain level...",
3192,,*,The volcano erupts...,
3193,,Valeera,Exactly. That's also the reason why we found the volcano looks a bit bigger than before.,
3194,,*,So the eruption this time...,
3195,,Valeera,I'm afraid it's because Magma Demon leaves the crater itself..,
3196,,Valeera,And for the size of it... Let's just imagine what will happen if the top of a full oxygen tank is removed...,
3197,,*,……………………,
3198,,Ithil,So it will be the biggest eruption ever...,
3199,,Valeera,I'm afraid this place is already no longer safe for us now.,
3200,,Mio,Meow... I will arrange evacuation.,
3201,,*,"...Sorry, I didn't know it would be like this.",
3202,,Mio,Meow... It wasn't your fault.,
3203,,Turin,Let me help you.,
3204,,Ithil,"...Turin, wait. If Valeera is correct, Magma Demon should be coming this way right now. We will need more people to fight.",
3205,,Turin,But...,
3206,,Mio,"Meow... Thank you, but please don't worry too much about us.",
3207,,*,Let's get out of the cave then. We need to find somewhere safe to prepare for the upcoming battle.,
3208,,,Yet I'm still worried about Iron Fist.,
3209,,*,"(We've got other things to do right now... Hang on, Iron Fist)",
3210,,*,Aquaris... Take Iron Fist and evacuate with the Hunters..,
3211,,Aquaris,"...Okay, stay safe.",
3212,,*,...Actually we're outnumbered.,
3213,,Valeera,……,
3214,,Ithil,"...Don't worry, we just need to buy them some time. And your life is first priority if things go wrong.",
3215,,*,(Sounds a lot easier than it actually is...),
3216,,*,"Turin, have you found any weak point on Magma Demon or any sign of the antique?",
3217,,Turin,Uh... The keratinized skin almost covers its entire body... Even most of its joint.,
3218,,Turin,"Only its eyes, mouth, and a tiny area on its back are exposed in the air.",
3219,,Turin,And the antique is definitely in it... But I can sense something powerful is hidden inside its body... So we won't be able to get the antique until we actually defeat that monster.,
3220,,*,Thanks for the effort.,
3221,,Rumpy,……,
3222,Duel,,We're now preparing for the battle in a wide-open area.,
3223,,,"There is no where to hide, and the ground could collapse anytime because of the earthquake... But this is the best place to fight that we can find right now...",
3224,,*,Ha... Just like waiting for a rival of a duel.,
3225,,Ithil,……,
3226,,,"My joke didn't work... Due to the enemy being too strong, this won't even be a fair fight.",
3227,,,An enormous Chaos Creature called Magma Demon... Which has become a living volcano. Is it really something we can defeat?,
3228,,,BOOM---,
3229,,,Volcano Hecrum's eruption has begun. We can even feel the impact from here.,
3230,,*,Will it come to us?,
3231,,Valeera,"I made marks with my magic on our way here, it will surely consider my marks a provocation...",
3232,,Turin,"By the way, where's Rumpy again? I just saw him following us...",
3233,,*,Forget it... He's totally unpredictable...,
3234,,Ithil,Here it comes.,
3235,,,...But it's not the Magma Demon.,
3236,,,A foehn is formed because of the eruption... It happens to become the first attack of Magma Demon.,
3237,,,"And with it, the volcanic ash soon covers the sky.",
3238,,,The lava spits out from the volcano and hits the ground. I'd say we're lucky to be far away from that.,
3239,,,Chaos Creatures created by toxic gas of the volcano starts to spawn around us.,
3240,,,And the monster that caused this disaster finally appears from the smoke…,
3241,,,It comes alone... Maybe he think what he brings is already enough.,
3242,,*,Finally...,
3243,,Magma Demon,Huh... Where's the rest of you? I'm not surprised though... At least you can entertain me for a little bit.,
3244,,Magma Demon,"It's a pity that I cannot eat your entire team. But, I consider this a salad before I start my main meal in your home, and capture your Earthvein...",
3245,,Magma Demon,And you will not be able to do anything about that! Hahaha!,
3246,,*,(...Earthvein?),
3247,,*,...Do it if you can. But this is no longer your turf!,
3248,,Magma Demon,You fight well with your mouth... Now let's see if your power fits what you've just said.,
3249,,,"I had an eye contact with my teammates, and they tell me they're ready.",
3250,,,This will be enough for now.,
3251,,*,Let's fight...!,
3252,Bewilderment,Mio,"Meow... Thank you, Aquaris. You can have a rest now, I'll go check out all the Hunters.",
3253,,Aquaris,"Okay... Just get it done quick, you'd also need a good rest.",
3254,,Aquaris,…………,
3255,,Aquaris,Iron Fist... What's wrong with you?,
3256,,Aquaris,I don't really understand what they said about the thing inside of you...,
3257,,Aquaris,But why don't you just tell us? It's a stupid move if you want to show us that you're strong...,
3258,,Aquaris,……,
3259,,Aquaris,I'll take Senpai from you if you don't wake up~,
3260,,Aquaris,……,
3261,,Aquaris,"Uh, that's not working...",
3262,,Aquaris,……,
3263,,Aquaris,Well... The eruption has begun... So Senpai and the seniors will start their fight...,
3264,,Aquaris,Their fight against that monster covered with lava...,
3265,,Aquaris,But why aren't they afraid about that? They will risk getting killed by that monster...,
3266,,Aquaris,And you... You shouldn't come with us with a sick body.,
3267,,Aquaris,That's totally unreasonable...,
3268,,Aquaris,……,
3269,,Aquaris,"Iron Fist, why can't you make your choices without any hesitation?",
3270,,Aquaris,No matter what you're going to face... No matter how much high of the price you have to pay... You won't be stopped...,
3271,,Aquaris,...I'm so curious about that. And that's what you made me so envious of you... This is also the reason I choose to follow you and find out what I want to know.,
3272,,Aquaris,But... Now you're in unconscious... And Senpai is fighting for his life...,
3273,,Aquaris,How can I even figure out the answer to my question without you and Senpai...,
3274,,Aquaris,"So please, wake up...",
3275,,Iron Fist,Aquaris...?,
3276,,Aquaris,！？,

3287,,Dire,"(Hehe... It's almost done... Now, become my puppet...!)",
3288,,,"The memory starts to reappear in front of me... Maybe this is just an illusion before death. I wake up in the sickbay, taken care of by Raphael and KongMing, get my prosthetic arm...",

3290,,,"Make my first friend, first conversation, first date...",
3291,,,Meet the most important people in my life.,
3292,,,It ends shortly. Just like the life of a butterfly...,
3293,,,KongMing... Senpai... Farewell.,
3294,,,I close my eyes... Waiting for the darkness to consume me.,
3295,,Iron Fist,But... I still hope I can leave with an audience...,
3296,,,And my hand happened to touch something... It's the letter from KongMing...,
3297,,Iron Fist,……！,
3298,,KongMing,"Iron Fist... If you're reading this, it means I failed to stop you to go with Senpai.",
3299,,KongMing,I have to tell you that this will be a tough trip... It will be extremely dangerous even with Ithil's help.,
3300,,KongMing,"But please remember, there will be some light guiding your path in the darkest moment.",

3336,,,"We lured it to an unstable ground and trapped him by making him collapse, but our plan failed.",

3338,,*,(But what to do after that? It's just a matter of time until we lose),

3346,,Ithil,"So, you think the exposed part in its back is the...",
3347,,Valeera,But... What can we do about that? Just attack from there?,
3348,,*,No... This weak point is too obvious so it's impossible for Magma Demon to ignore that.,
3349,,Turin,What should we do then...?,
3350,,*,………………！？,
3351,,,When we're still trying to figure out a way to hit Magma Demon's back. I notice a tiny cat sneaked towards the place we want to reach.,
3352,,*,...I think all we need to do is to attract that monster and buy some time.,
3353,,Turin,???,
3354,,Ithil,...Oh. You mean Rumpy.,
3355,,Ithil,I never thought you would trust him that much. Since you didn't like each other in the past.,

3370,,,Taking that hit almost took my life... And this is already the best I can do right now.,
3371,,Magma Demon,You're hard to kill. Just like a real insect...,
3372,,,"It starts to approach me... Even with the protection from Valeera's spells, the monster's heat still almost melts my skin.",
3373,,,And my hands hurts the most.,
3374,,,"The smoke are keeping me from breathing... And soon, it also covers my sight...",
3375,,*,…,
3376,,,I tried my best to escape from its trample.,
3377,,Magma Demon,Ha! Why don't you just die!,
3378,,*,Rumpy is still not ready yet?!,
3379,,,The next strike will surely kill me...,
3380,,,"But at the dire moment, I finally found that tiny white figure on the back of Magma Demon.",
3381,,,Perfect... Our effort has been paid off...,
3382,,Magma Demon,...What...!? How did he???,
3383,,,"When Magma Demon finally finds out what had happened, it's already too late.",
3384,,,Rumpy struggled himself out of Magma Demon's body. I believe he'll start to scream immediately if there's nothing in his mouth.,
3385,,Ithil,That's the antique we've been talking about all along...,
3386,,Valeera,A red... Crystal?,
3387,,,It's the crystal I've seen in my dream...,
3388,,*,We've won...,
3389,,Magma Demon,Ahhhhhh!!! Insects! How dare you do this to me! I'll kill you. I'll kill you all!,
3390,,,But Magma Demon's roar is more like impotent rage... Now his body is starting to crumble.,
3391,,Turin,???,
3392,,Valeera,"The antique stabilized the lava inside of it, without that, Magma Demon will surely lose control of its lava... That's also the reason why the volcano erupts when the antique is taken from it.",
3393,,*,"So, now it's turning into a living bomb...?",
3394,,Ithil,And I strongly suggest you get out of there!,
3395,,Magma Demon,Damn it! My crystal...!!!,
3396,,,The lava keeps spilling out of Magma Demon's body.,
3397,,Magma Demon,Even if I die... I will bring you down with me!,
3398,,*,Crap... It's too close...!,
3399,,Turin,Senpai!,
3400,,Ithil,……！,
3401,,,Is this the end of me?,
3402,,,That's a real shame. I will never get my chance to save Iron Fist from her misery...,
3403,,,"It's getting dark, but I can only feel a strong wind hitting me...",
3404,The Last Struggle,,"I've prepared for my death... But after the wind, nothing hits me.",
3405,,,...What's going on?,
3406,,Iron Fist,"Senpai, it's too early to give up.",
3407,,*,Iron Fist...?,
3408,,,When I become conscious again... I found myself being taken away from Magma Demon. And the Iron Fist standing next to me looks like a completely different person.,
3409,,Turin,Huh!? How can it be...?,
3410,,Mio,Meow... We are here to help.,
3411,,Aquaris,That's right! Sorry to keep you wai...(Coughs)...Valeera cast a spell and get the ash away from me! I can't breathe!,
3412,,*,Can anyone tell me what's going on?,
3413,,Ithil,I also have my own questions... But I suggest you save them after the battle!,
3414,,Magma Demon,Haha! Now all of you are here? That's right. Everyone will die with me!!!,
3415,,Iron Fist,You won't succeed... I will save everyone from you.,
3416,,*,"...Maybe we can defeat the monster right now. Alright, it's time to end this once and for all.",
3417,,Iron Fist,"Senpai, let me show you my new power.",
3418,,Magma Demon,Arrogant fool... I will rip your wings off of you!,
3419,,,Iron Fist hovers in the sky and strikes the Magma Demon's weak points.,
3420,,Ithil,Her moves are amazing.,
3421,,,Even Ithil is impressed by Iron Fist.,
3422,,Magma Demon,Damn it!!!! I've already lived for 170 years... How can I die here!!!,
3423,,Iron Fist,Your terror over this land ends here and now!,
3424,,,"Iron Fist's last strike pierces through Magma Demon's armor, totally stopping it.",

3426,,Aquaris,...Is it all over?,
3427,,*,Maybe...,
3428,,Aquaris,Finally...,
3429,,*,Now it's time for questions I think...,
3430,,*,"But since we've just been through a tough battle, maybe we should leave the questions after a good rest.",
3431,,Ithil,Something's wrong... It's not dead yet!,
3432,,Magma Demon,I told you...! I will bring you down with me!!!,
3433,,*,……！？,
3434,,,"Magma Demon struggles up, it's going to explode.",
3435,,Magma Demon,Hahaha!!! Now die with pain and despair in my blood!,
3436,,,The lava inside the Magma monster is pouring towards us.,
3437,,Iron Fist,Senpai!!,
3438,,Valeera,Oh no... My magic won't be able to hold that off!,
3439,,Aquaris,Ahhhhh!!! We're going to die!,
3440,,Rumpy,Meow---!,
3441,,,...The antique in Rumpy's mouth starts to shine as he jumped in front of us.,
3442,,Mio,……！？,
3443,,,Most of the lava cools down with the remaining unable to penetrate Valeera's barrier.,
3444,,*,Rumpy...?,
3445,,,That is a surprise. But this is not the most important issue.,
3446,,Aquaris,"Wait, is that monster still not dead yet?",
3447,,,"Finally, Magma Demon is not moving anymore, turning into giant ugly stone with Chaos power leaking out.",
3448,,Ithil,...It's not moving anymore. This is all over.,
3449,,Valeera,(Exhales)... Finally.,
3450,,,"Rumpy turns and stares at me. But I feel like it wasn't Rumpy doing this at first contact... But soon, the eyes turns innocent again.",

3454,,Turin,Rumpy!,
3455,,,Turin rushed to Rumpy and checked him.,
3456,,Turin,Don't worry. He is just asleep.,
3457,,*,He really lets himself go...,
3458,,*,...But this is finally over.,
3459,,,"But at the cost of pollution in the air, the collapse of the Earth, and the scars on the rocks.",
3460,,,"We've made it, and the Earth pays the price for our victory. I doubt if any luck like this in the future.",
3461,,Iron Fist,Senpai... I don't feel right...,
3462,,,...Maybe our luck is used up already.,
3463,,*,Iron Fist...!?,
3464,,,"No one feels wrong when the Chaos power leaking out from Magma Demon gets close, except Iron Fist.",
3465,,*,...This is happening again!?,
3466,,Ithil,"Come on, let's first get to safety.",

3468,No Time to Celebrate,,"After a while, Mio takes Rumpy to settle the Hunters as we're waiting for the Iron Fist's diagnosis to finish.",
3469,,*,Is Iron Fist out of danger?,
3470,,Turin,"She's fallen asleep, and her prosthetic arm has returned to normal.",
3471,,Turin,It appears that Iron Fist gets new gear because of the prosthetic arm... I believe there's a lot of secrets hiding inside.,
3472,,Turin,The good news is that I can no longer detect Dire from her body...,
3473,,Turin,But the other Chaos power isn't fading... I don't know why.,
3474,,Turin,"Currently, she's fine. But I'm not sure she will still be fine if anything happens.",
3475,,*,That's just...,
3476,,Aquaris,How can it be...? Iron Fist was so energetic when fighting Magma Demon.,
3477,,Ithil,Are we going to return to the Academy or something? Your call.,

3479,,*,……,

3481,,Valeera,It won't waste too much time.,
3482,,*,Let me think about it...,
3483,,Ithil,Fair enough.,
3484,,Mio,Meow... May I come in?,
3485,,Rumpy,……,
3486,,,"Mio enters the tent with Rumpy---who looks terrible, but not hurt.",
3487,,Mio,Meow... Magma Demon is defeated... I'm here to thank you.,
3488,,*,But... You home was also destroyed because of this...,
3489,,Mio,Meow... The cave is never our home. Our home was destroyed 50 years ago.,
3490,,Mio,"Meow... With ""The eye of Vulcan"" reclaimed, we are free to go anywhere we want.",
3491,,*,So... Have you decided where to go?,
3492,,Mio,"Meow... Not yet, but we can live anywhere with trees.",
3493,,*,...What about Yume Academy?,
3494,,Mio,Meow...???,
3495,,*,"The Academy is surrounded by forest. Although there will still be some Chaos Creatures spawning around, it's safer than other places at least.",

3501,,Turin,……,
3502,,Mio,Meow... I should thank you too. You are no longer that evil person you used to be. Sorry for being rude to you at the beginning.,
3503,,Turin,Thank you...,
3504,,Mio,Meow... Please take this with you.,
3505,,*,"""The eye of Vulcan""? Why do you give that to me? Isn't that your relic?",
3506,,Mio,"Meow... Just take it, I believe you can make good use of it... You deserve this.",
3507,,*,So... I did pass your test...?,
3508,,Mio,"Meow... I'm not sure what it means, but I do hope you're not the person in our prophecy.",
3509,,*,Why?,
3510,,Mio,"Meow... In the second part of the prophecy, it says the fire will perish in vain, and the tears of the sacred fire will water the soil of the end.",
3511,,*,...What does that mean?,
3512,,Mio,Meow... This is the reason I hope you're not the chosen one...,
3513,,*,……,
3514,,Mio,Meow... And now we don't need that anymore.,
3515,,Mio,Because our god now stands with us.,
3516,,,Mio quickly peeked at Rumpy as she speaks... Was that my illusion?,
3517,,,Maybe we should try and discover all his secrets some day.,
3518,,Mio,Meow... How about Iron Fist?,
3519,,*,Not good.,
3520,,Mio,Meow... Tell us if you need any help.,
3521,,*,"I will, but now the Hunters would need you more.",
3522,,Mio,Meow... Are you leaving?,
3523,,*,I'm not sure.,
3524,,Mio,"Meow... No matter what, I hope you can finish your mission.",
3525,,Mio,Meow... It's time for me to leave. We will set out for Yume Academy tomorrow.,
3526,,*,You take care of yourselves.,

3528,,Turin,"Thank you, Senpai. Now I got my redemption.",
3529,,Turin,Maybe we can see Hunters playing in the forest when we heal Iron Fist and return.,
3530,,*,Yeah...,
3531,,Ithil,It's bed time. I suggest you all go to sleep at once.,
3532,,Aquaris,But I think it's necessary to leave one of us here and take care of Iron Fist.,
3533,,Turin,I'm supervising Iron Fist's condition. Don't worry about that.,
3534,,Aquaris,Oh... Okay...,
3535,,Valeera,Night night... I've cast too many spells today...,
3536,,*,Have a full night's sleep.,
3537,From now on,,"No strange dream this time, but I still don't feel sleepy.",
3538,,,And the reason is obvious.,
3539,,,"After a while, I still cannot fall asleep.",
3540,,*,(...Maybe I should take a walk),
3541,,,"Outside the tent, volcanic ash is still floating in the air, and the temperature is still high because of the volcano's eruption.",
3542,,*,(...The walk will only make it worse!),
3543,,*,Huh...? Ithil...,

3545,,*,I think it's no longer necessary to keep watch at night,
3546,,Ithil,"Just in case, and I've already got used to it.",
3547,,*,I see...,
3548,,,But I believe she's here only because she cannot fall asleep either.,
3549,,Ithil,……,
3550,,Ithil,We've paid a dear price this time.,
3551,,Ithil,And we are just lucky to get the antique.,
3552,,Ithil,Do you still believe you made the right choice now?,
3553,,*,...I do.,
3554,,*,And we've also earned the trust of Hunter's tribe.,
3555,,Ithil,But our luck will use up.,
3556,,Ithil,"Besides, your sending Hunters back to the Academy will definitely attract D.E.F's attention. Thus making our journey even harder.",
3557,,*,Ithil... But actually I start to have this feeling after this battle.,
3558,,*,What we're up against... Is not something we can defeat alone.,
3559,,,The burn on my hands still hurts.,
3560,,*,And we need to unite everyone we can.,
3561,,*,"No matter who, even D.E.F is worth a try.",
3562,,*,Everything is necessary for our ultimate goal.,

3566,,Ithil,"But, maybe you're right...",
3567,,Ithil,This is the only way to create a possibility to win this war...,
3568,,,Ithil takes out the 2 tags she has been carrying while she was speaking.,
3569,,*,So…,
3570,,Ithil,The sun is coming out.,
3571,,*,Yes...,
3572,,,The sunlight starts to appear from the horizon.,
3573,,Ithil,The moonlight will perish someday.,
3574,,,What does that mean?,
3575,,Ithil,Fine... Maybe it is also my duty to make you not so naive.,
3576,,*,...Thank you so much.,
3577,,Ithil,"So, have you made your decision?",
3578,,*,Iron Fist won't become any better even if we return...,
3579,,*,There's only one way to save her...,
3580,,,I remembered something in KongMing's letter...,
3581,,*,We need to find Sivney.,

3583,,,"Originally I had decided to hang out with Iron Fist, but I didn't find her in her room.",
3584,,,It's not like going to the library is the worst way to spend my time. I can still share the book I read yesterday if I run into Valeera or Librarian.,
3585,,Librarian,Senpai? I knew it was you. You are the only one on campus with nothing to do.,
3586,,*,"… Good morning to you too, Librarian! Don't you think that's a bit harsh?",
3587,,*,I'm on my way to the library right now. Would you care to join me?,
3588,,Librarian,"You know Senpai, I usually wouldn't refuse such an invitation, but... it's kind of a bad time.",
3589,,*,Does that mean you have something more important to do?,
3590,,Librarian,"Well, I feel I should be asking YOU that, Senpai.",
3591,,*,"Not exactly. I didn't find Iron Fist in her Dorm, and I haven't seen anyone about except you...",
3592,,*,Is there a festival on campus and everyone is there celebrating?,
3593,,Librarian,Seriously? Today is the first day of the Sports Meeting!,
3594,,*,(Sports Meeting?... That certainly rings a bell... But I didn't sign up for any competitions in the past...),
3595,,*,It's interesting. I don't know what you would do in this kind of event.,
3596,,*,I guess I'm not participating this time. Totally forgot about it...,
3597,,Librarian,That makes sense... Since you prefer to take the backseat in most things.,
3598,,Valeera,"Librarian, what took you so long?! Everyone's waiting for you!",
3599,,Valeera,"Out of the way, Senpai! Unlike you, Librarian has some important business to take care of~",
3600,,Librarian,The important mission you mentioned... Is that looking after the prize box?,
3601,,*,Valeera? What's with the costume? Are you a referee?,
3602,,*,I never thought you would take Sports Meeting so seriously~,
3603,,Valeera,"Senpai, for such a big event, the winners will be awarded with something special!",
3604,,Valeera,"Maybe it means nothing to you, but it means a lot to us~",
3605,,*,I see. Otherwise you'd be stuck inside your library~,
3606,,*,"As a referee, how can you support your House?",
3607,,Librarian,"Senpai, you probably should keep that to yourself...",
3608,,Librarian,It seems to be a very sensitive subject for Valeera...,
3609,,Valeera,They just said that I'm not good at sports... Thus I'm the perfect choice for the referee.,
3610,,Librarian,This is the reason that I cannot join you in the library today~,
3611,,Librarian,"Don't get down on yourself, Valeera. Being a referee is an important job~",
3612,,Valeera,"Thank you, Librarian. I will do my best. Maybe we can read together after the Sports Meeting is over, Senpai~",
3613,,,Looks like everyone's waiting for them. Valeera just rushed off with Librarian...,
3614,,*,"Wait, if I join a House temporarily, maybe I can join the Sports Meeting?",
3615,,Valeera,What?,
3616,,Librarian,"Senpai, do you mean you want to join us?",
3617,,*,Yes! I just want to join in and enjoy the event! I don't care that much about the rewards.,
3618,,Valeera,"I'm glad to hear that. Please join my House, then! Without me, House Ghost will need someone like you to keep the balance on the field.",
3619,,Librarian,Don't be too hasty in making your decision!,
3620,,Librarian,"You should think it over. Otherwise some of the girls, like Iron Fist, might feel disappointed~",
3621,,*,"Huh? Oh, you're right, Librarian! (If it weren't for her, I might have forgotten!)",
3622,,Valeera,Okay... Then we should let Senpai join the House that fits him the most the proper way---,
3623,,*,What's the proper way?,
3624,,Valeera,"Here, complete this questionnaire! We had some other students who also wanted to join the Sports Meeting with your situation. I made this questionnaire to help them out!",
3625,,,Where was she keeping this? The referee's uniform has no pockets...,
3626,,Valeera,"Alright, take a moment to fill it out. And afterward, my magic will tell me which House should you join.",
3627,,Valeera,"We have something else to attend to! See you later, Senpai~",
3628,,Librarian,"See you at the Sports Meeting, Senpai~",
3629,,*,"Hey, wait!... They're not stopping this time.",
3630,,*,"Whatever, I should just follow Valeera's instructions. At least no one will blame me for this later...",
3631,,,"Question 1: You are in the library, but you have few books to choose from.",
3632,,,Which book will you borrow?,"""7 Campus Mysteries""|""Sonya's Recipes""|""Yume News""|""G.N.D, the Game: Rulebook"""
3633,,,Question 2: One morning you wake up and find yourself in a strange white room with nothing in it.,
3634,,,You reach into your pocket for one item. That item is:,An unfinished book from last night|Boro's yoyo|A blue pill|An iron fan

3645,,Psychic,Okay... I'm putting my faith in you... Just keep looking.,
3646,,Bruno,Woof!,
3647,,Psychic,"Finally... Wait, Mio, get off that lamppost! It's dangerous!",
3648,,Mio,Meow!?,
3649,,Psychic,Bad kitty!,
3650,,,It looked like Mio was taking her time researching this lamppost. Psychic's words distracted her and made her lose her grip...,
3651,,,"But luckily, Mio reacted quickly and landed on all four feet. It was a safe landing with no sound.",
3652,,,Her cat-like reflexes made you forget that she had lost her footing in the first place.,
3653,,Psychic,(Nimble like a cat...),
3654,,Mio,Meow... Psychic?,
3655,,Psychic,That was a perfect landing... but I still want to know why you were on that lamppost.,
3656,,Mio,Lamppost? So this tree is named Lamppost! Amazing!!,
3657,,Psychic,That's not a tree. This is quite common on campus. What makes it so special for you?,
3658,,Mio,It's glowing.,
3659,,Psychic,… So it is.,
3660,,Mio,Is there fire inside?,
3661,,Psychic,Uh... That would be dangerous. We use electricity now.,
3662,,Mio,Electricity...,
3663,,,Mio repeated the word several times.,
3664,,Mio,Meow! I see... Can I use electricity too?!,
3665,,Psychic,Well... That's a little bit difficult to answer. But I have many electronic devices I could let you borrow.,
3666,,Mio,Meow... Are those useful in combat?,
3667,,Psychic,… In combat?,
3668,,Mio,"Meow, like the ones Iron Fist and Turin have! Those glowing electronic tools!",
3669,,Psychic,Oh... You mean weapons...,
3670,,Psychic,"We have developed some of those, but I currently don't have any for you.",
3671,,Mio,...,

3674,,Psychic,Hey! No promises... not so tight... mmph!,
3675,,Psychic,"(She feels just like a giant cat, but cuter...)",
3676,,Psychic,"So, that's the story... KongMing, can you help her?",
3677,,KongMing,"Hmm… electric, glowing weapons...",
3678,,KongMing,I can't think of any that suit Mio.,
3679,,Psychic,Why?,
3680,,KongMing,Mio has the power to control fire. Electric weapons don't last under heat.,
3681,,Mio,Meow... That's too bad.,
3682,,,Mio was clearly disappointed by the answer.,
3683,,Psychic,"I know it sucks, but don't feel too bad. You're already strong enough without weapons.",
3684,,Mio,"That's not true, meow... There can be fire-proof enemies, like the ones I fought inside the volcano. But if I can have other methods of attack...",
3685,,KongMing,……,
3686,,KongMing,If that's what you need... I have just the thing. Wait here.,
3687,,KongMing,"Ugh... This is heavy... make way, please!",
3688,,,KongMing returned with a heavy white bag. The bag made a huge thump when it hit the table. One could only imagine how much trouble KongMing went through to carry it here.,
3689,,Psychic,"KongMing, what IS this the thing!?",
3690,,KongMing,This is a prototype from my former research.,
3691,,,KongMing opened the bag as she spoke.,
3692,,Psychic,These are... guns?,
3693,,,"Inside the bag, there're 2 metal... Pistols? They look much longer.",
3694,,,"Both were connected to a can filled with liquid, but it was unclear what the liquid was used for.",
3695,,KongMing,"You're right. They're steam-powered muskets. Not electronic, so they are perfect for Mio.",
3696,,Mio,Steam-meowskets?,
3697,,Psychic,Which means...,
3698,,KongMing,These two cans connected to the muskets are actually steam tanks. They are the power source for this weapon.,
3699,,KongMing,You can heat the cans and create steam to increase the pressure.,
3700,,KongMing,"When the pressure reaches a certain limit, it will be powerful enough to propel the bullet out of the barrel.",
3701,,KongMing,"But the problem is that it will need a heat source when you use it, and the muskets are already heavy. I considered it a failure.",
3702,,Psychic,I don't see the heater here...,
3703,,KongMing,"That's right. Mio can simply heat the tanks herself, as she is the perfect heat source. I'm sure the heat means nothing to her.",
3704,,Psychic,Umm...,
3705,,KongMing,"Mio, why don't you give them a shot?",
3706,,Mio,Meow!,
3707,,,"It was like Mio was waiting for KongMing to say the word. She quickly put on the tanks, and very soon the liquid inside started to boil.",
3708,,KongMing,Watch the pressure gauge. The muskets will be ready once it reaches yellow.,
3709,,KongMing,"Of course, the power of the shots will increase if the pressure is higher, but don't let them reach red. That's the pressure limit for the tanks.",
3710,,Mio,"What happens, meow?",
3711,,KongMing,They might explode.,
3712,,Mio,MEOW!!,
3713,,,"Mio almost dropped the muskets on in shock. Maybe to avoid a  possible explosion, she stopped heating the tanks at once.",
3714,,KongMing,"... I anticipated such a possibility, so I designed a release valve that can discharge steam to avoid this. It won't go off in most kinds of situations.",
3715,,KongMing,But you still need to avoid reaching red on the pressure gauge. The steam won't resupply itself.,
3716,,Mio,Meow... I think I get it?,
3717,,KongMing,Now the musket is ready to fire. All you need to do is pull the trigger right here…,
3718,,Mio,Meow... Like this?,
3719,,Psychic,"Wait, not here!!!",
3720,,,Mio fired the muskets before Psychic could stop her.,
3721,,,"After the noise, there is only some smoke floating out of the muzzle, and the bullet is no longer inside the chamber.",
3722,,KongMing,"Well... Judging by the noise, it's a successful shot.",
3723,,Psychic,I just hope no one got hit...,
3724,,KongMing,"Don't worry, the power for that shot just merely launched the bullet. It will lose momentum pretty quickly.",
3725,,Mio,"Meow... I like the sound. It means I can hit enemies from a distance, right?",
3726,,KongMing,"Exactly, but I suggest you practice some more.",
3727,,Mio,"I will, meow! I'll head to the shooting range right now!",
3728,,Psychic,... Be careful when you use them.,
3729,,Psychic,I wonder if she will heed my advice...,
3730,,KongMing,"Mio... She chose to join my House, but she's still curious about other things. It's a good sign.",
3731,,KongMing,Maybe it's because she comes from somewhere else.,
3732,,Psychic,"What are you talking about? You're also in House Fairy, but now you are the best scientist on campus.",
3733,,KongMing,……,
3734,,KongMing,"... That's just out of luck. For most of the students, they just take everything for granted, so they ignore the strange things about this Academy.",
3735,,Psychic,What strange things?,
3736,,KongMing,"For example, have you ever noticed what supplies electricity for the Academy?",
3737,,Psychic,…I actually don't know...,
3738,,Mio,Steam... meowskets...,
3739,,Mio,"Maybe KongMing will be angry if I damage it, meow.",
3740,,Mio,Meow... I should use them carefully.,
3741,,Rumpy,……,
3742,,Mio,"Uh... Oh, Rumpy...?",
3743,,Rumpy,Meow.,
3744,,Mio,"Where are you going, meow?",
3745,,Rumpy,Meow... Meow!,
3746,,Mio,You've got something to show me meow?,
3747,,Mio,Wait for me!,
3748,,KongMing,"Just like I said, the steam muskets are just prototypes from my research.",
3749,,KongMing,It's for figuring out the source of our electricity supply.,
3750,,KongMing,But... I still don't have any clues.,
3751,,KongMing,It's ironic... The truth is always lying right in front of us... But we're just too arrogant to see it.,
3752,,Psychic,The power source... Where is it?,
3753,,KongMing,Right beneath us.,
3754,,Mio,"We're… underground, meow?",
3755,,Rumpy,……,
3756,,Mio,Meow... It feels weird.,
3757,,Mio,"Rumpy, meow, what are you trying to show me?",
3758,,Rumpy,Meow.,
3759,,Mio,What's... This...?,
3760,,Mio,Meow... I can feel the heat...,
3761,,Mio,It just feels like when I was heating the steam tanks.,
3762,,KongMing,When the pressure inside the tanks reaches its limit... they might explode.,
3763,,Mio,……………………,
3764,,Mio,Meow... It doesn't feel good.,
3765,,Mio,I need to tell KongMing at once!,
3766,Story Preview,Librarian,(Sigh)... Why Valeera left in a rush? Now I have to clean up the library for her...,
3767,,Librarian,I don't hate to spend my time with so many books.,
3768,,Librarian,But this library is just too enormous… And the noise from upstairs is freaking me out…,
3769,,Librarian,I hope it's not something like a ghost...,
3770,,Librarian,Maybe I was just bothering myself.,
3771,,Librarian,……！？,
3772,,Librarian,Who... Who's that?,
3773,,Librarian,No one's responding...,
3774,,Librarian,...Maybe I'm just too tired to have a hallucination. I should finish sorting this final shelf and head back to my dorm...,
3775,,Librarian,Huh?,
3776,,？？？,…………,
3777,,？？？,Grand Library Ulbricht...,
3778,,？？？,Valeera must have hidden it here...,
3779,,？？？,As I predicted... Kratos would like to see this.,
3780,,Sonya,Tch... I wonder she's a beast with human skin!,
3781,,Guan Yin,She's using every part of her body to attack... Just like those barbaric beasts.,
3782,,Fenrir,Hahaha… You totally don't know how to fight.,
3783,,Fenrir,"But for newbies, you've done well so far… Kratos can wait for a little bit longer.",
3784,,Fenrir,I shall take my time.,
3785,,Joan,Be extremely cautious… She's really trying to kill us.,
3786,,Jacob,Sister… Do we have to do this?,
3787,,Esau,"There's no other way, we're on our own now.",
3788,,Esau,It took us so much to earn a peaceful life... With you. I don't wish to lose it.,
3789,,Jacob,Neither do I… This is our new home… And we're planning to stick around longer.,
3790,,Jacob,"Sister, your hands are shaking.",
3791,,Esau,"Jacob, don't pretend yours are not shaking...!",
3792,,Jacob,"…Whatever, let's do this, sister.",
3793,,Esau,Okay!,
3794,,KongMing,These files… They're not ready for this.,
3795,,KongMing,Maybe they will have to face the truth some time later.,
3796,,KongMing,But before that… I shall keep it a secret.,
3797,,Lucifer,……,
3798,,Lucifer,What is this?,
3799,,Lucifer,Damn... Why do I feel woozy right after waking up...,
3800,,Lucifer,Ah... I forgot... I passed out during that test...,
3801,,Lucifer,But how long have I been in this coma for?,Look around
3802,,,"A tidy white room, seems like a ward. Guess I'm the patient.",
3803,,,"My bed is near the door, and there's another one near the window. I can vaguely see another patient lying on it, but I cannot tell how she looks like because of the curtain between us.",
3804,,Lucifer,Where am I...?,
3805,,？？？,"Wow... I'm glad to see you have recovered, Lucifer.",
3806,,？？？,"You just passed out for no reason, making everyone worried.",
3807,,,"A female enters the room with grace. On her left hand there's a plate holding towel, water and lots of medicine that I don't recognize. But I doubt she's a nurse, she is far too gorgeous to be one.","Don't get closer, old woman!|Who are you?"
3808,,Lucifer,"Don't get closer, old woman!",
3809,,？？？,Uh...,
3810,,,"Apparently, this lady finds my words offensive and seems displeased. Her fingers are gripping the plate she's holding extremely tight, I can even see the plate's getting bent... Satan help the stuff she placed on this poor plate.",
3811,,,"But even with that, she still managed to continue smiling. This made an impressive scene: a woman trying to stop herself from killing the person who offended her while managing to keep a graceful smile on her face.",
3812,,？？？,"...Very well... It's been a long time since I got called an ""old woman""...",
3813,,？？？,Lucifer... I will not hurt you since you're a patient and have lost your memory...,
3814,,？？？,But I won't hold myself back next time...,"Try me, O-L-D W-O-M-A-N|So, how am I supposed to call you?"
3815,,,"Try me, O-L-D W-O-M-A-N",
3816,,,"Trust me, this was what I originally planned to say, but I decided to be more polite, because I'm not afraid at all...",
3817,,Lucifer,Who are you?,
3818,,Lucifer,What am I supposed to call you?,
3819,,Raphael,"I'm the doctor of the Academy, Raphael, you can call me doctor... Maybe sister is a more suitable address.",
3820,,Lucifer,"Whatever, where am I, Raphael?",
3821,,Raphael,(She's still rude though...),
3822,,Raphael,"Well... You were taken to the Healthcare room of the Academy after you passed out. There are no problems with your body, so I'd like to know if you felt anything strange before you passed out.",
3823,,Lucifer,Uh... I remember this happened after completing the test with that angel girl. But that's all that I can remember.,
3824,,Raphael,(Angel girl?... She must be referring to Michael),
3825,,Raphael,Okay? And before that?,
3826,,Lucifer,"Before that? This is the first thing I did that day worth mentioning. But there was something strange during the test yesterday, if you insist on knowing.",
3827,,Lucifer,I had a long dream... It was like I was flowing in a river of light beams.,
3828,,Lucifer,"And I was one of them, a black one.",
3829,,Lucifer,"Oh... By the way, there's an annoying golden beam that follows me wherever I go.",
3830,,Lucifer,"After spending a long time flowing in the river, i somehow found an exit--- I didn't know what it was but I felt like it was an exit.",
3831,,Lucifer,And before I could get out of there... I woke up. And found myself and the angel girl in an unfamiliar forest.,
3832,,Raphael,That's the location the Discipline Committee found you.,
3833,,Raphael,……,
3834,,Lucifer,Are you trying to say something?,
3835,,Raphael,Uh... Do you remember anything before that dream?,
3836,,Lucifer,Again? Seriously? I've told you a million times that I cannot remember anything. I believe that shorty called KongMing has also told you that.,
3837,,Raphael,...So... Your memory hasn't recovered yet...,
3838,,Raphael,……,
3839,,Lucifer,Hey.,
3840,,Raphael,……,
3841,,Lucifer,"Hey, Raphael!",
3842,,Raphael,…………,OLD WOMAN!!!
3843,,Lucifer,"...Respond, you old bat!",
3844,,Raphael,### I think I already told you not to call me that.,
3845,,Lucifer,… Name another method I can get you to pay attention to me.,
3846,,Raphael,Okay... I'll consider that as an emergency measure.,
3847,,Lucifer,"So... After all this interrogation, or should I call it ""therapy"", do you have any progress yet?",
3848,,Raphael,"Sorry, I have no idea.",
3849,,Lucifer,What a lousy doctor.,
3850,,Lucifer,"But since you said my body is fine, can I go now?",
3851,,Raphael,"That's true, but... Since you insist, you can leave now.",
3852,,Lucifer,Goodbye. I don't want to stay in this ward any longer.,
3853,,Raphael,"Lucifer, your clothes were kept in the locker room outside. Please don't forget to attend your classes tomorrow~",
3854,,Lucifer,"Fine, fine… (No I won't)",
3855,,Lucifer,But wait.. Tomorrow's Monday?,
3856,,Raphael,"That's right. Today is Sunday, October 21st.",
3857,,Lucifer,I've been in coma for 6 days already?,
3858,,,*alarm clock sound*,
3859,,Lucifer,What the...,
3860,,,"The noise woke me up from my sweet dream. I'm sure this sound was designed to stress you out, why does this kind of sound even exist in the world?",
3861,,,It shouldn't have been created.,
3862,,,*alarm clock sound*,
3863,,Lucifer,There's no end to this.,
3864,,,"I try to block out the noise by burying my head into the pillows, but that plan doesn't work well.",
3865,,,*alarm clock sound*,
3866,,Lucifer,"Alright, that's enough.",Find where the sound comes from
3867,,,"I try to search for the sound with my eyes closed--- I admit it is more troublesome this way, but I will be able to fall back asleep once I deal with this sound.",
3868,,Lucifer,Got you...,
3869,,,"I think the sound is coming from the beside cabinet, so I raise my right hand and... Slam!!!",
3870,,,*alarm clock sound*,
3871,,,But the noise keeps coming,Slam again
3872,,Lucifer,Damn... Who created this?,
3873,,Lucifer,DIEEEEE!!!,
3874,,,This slam had more force... And the noise finally stopped.,
3875,,,"But my hand also feels a little sore from that last slam, and I don't feel sleepy anymore.",
3876,,Lucifer,Tch... My morning is ruined.,
3877,,,"Guess I have no other choice. I have to get off the bed and look around, that might distract me from the pain.",Look around
3878,,,"Despite how untidy the room is, it's a lot better than the ward I've been staying in for the last week.",
3879,,,The guitar hung on the wall is the only thing in the right place.,
3880,,Lucifer,And where's the noise maker?,
3881,,,"There's a grey box on the bedside cabinet, guess that's where the sound was coming from.",Check
3882,,,"It's an electronic alarm clock. I can see a button on the top, maybe it's used to stop the noise.",
3883,,,"According to the fist-shaped impression on the surface, I guess someone used the wrong method.",
3884,,Lucifer,"I guess old habits die hard, even after losing my memory.",
3885,,,"For some reason, I can understand the information that the figures on this machine provide.",
3886,,Lucifer,It's October 22nd…,
3887,,Lucifer,It's... 11 o'clock. It should be class time according to that old bat.,
3888,,Lucifer,…………,
3889,,Lucifer,What time do classes begin?,
3890,,Lucifer,"Whatever, that's not something I want to care about.",
3891,,Lucifer,The walkway is desolated. I guess I'm early...,
3892,,Lucifer,So where's the school building?,
3893,,Lucifer,……,
3894,,Lucifer,Is it because I ignored the old bat and shorty... Or did they forget to mention it in the first place?,
3895,,Lucifer,"Whatever, I guess I need to walk around and find out myself.",
3896,,Lucifer,"Yume Academy... According to the shorty, I used to be a student here before I lost my memories.",
3897,,Lucifer,But why doesn't anyone know what happened to me?,
3898,,？？？,Lucifer... Finally found you.,
3899,,,"While wandering in the campus, a girl in strange costume comes my way.",
3900,,,"Exaggerated clothes, ridiculous accessories, an arrogant character and... a pair of rabbit ears?",A... Rabbit?
3901,,Lucifer,Do I know you... Rabbit?,
3902,,？？？,Huh...?,
3903,,,She looks surprised and I don't know why. Doesn't she know that there's always a pair of rabbit ears on her head?,
3904,,？？？,"Stop playing, there's no one else here. You must act like you don't know me and pretend to be a new student for some reason, right?",
3905,,？？？,"Thanks to you, I have to clean up the mess in D.E.F. What on earth was your plan?",
3906,,Lucifer,What are you talking about? Cut the nonsense already... I don't have any idea what you're saying.,
3907,,Lucifer,Who are you? What is D.E.F.? Why are you trying to find me?,
3908,,？？？,... I should remind you that you should stop hiding right now.,
3909,,Lucifer,"Since you're not helping at all, why should I answer your question?",
3910,,Lucifer,"This is enough, I've got no time to waste, get out of my way.",
3911,,？？？,……,
3912,,,So I turn back and try to get away from this moron. She's ruined my mood already.,
3913,,,"All of a sudden, I notice something approaching.",
3914,,,It's a poker card. It flies by my face and pierces the wall in front of me.,
3915,,,I didn't even notice my wound until it started to bleed. I'd say that wound could've been lethal if I didn't react fast enough.,
3916,,Lucifer,Hey... What are you doing! Do you really want to feel how hard I can punch?,
3917,,？？？,You've become weak... This would've meant nothing to you in the past…,
3918,,？？？,"I should pay you a compliment if this is a part of your plan, but that doesn't seem like something you'd do.",
3919,,？？？,So you actually have lost your memory.,
3920,,？？？,"… Now this is convenient. You don't know anything anymore, now go and enjoy your school life.",
3921,,,*class bell sound*,
3922,,,The sound... It signals the beginning of class. I should use that bunny girl as an excuse for me being late.,
3923,,？？？,"It's going to get busy, see you later~",
3924,,Lucifer,Hey! Stop right there! You think I'll let you go so easily after all that?,
3925,,？？？,So? What's your point?,
3926,,Lucifer,"Tell me, who are you? And what is D.E.F.?",
3927,,？？？,That's not something you need to know.,
3928,,Lucifer,……,
3929,,Lucifer,... That coward ran away so fast.,
3930,,Lucifer,Why am I so unlucky that I'd meet someone like that?!,
3931,,Lucifer,Everything she did after meeting me was just plain nonsense.,
3932,,Lucifer,And suspicious...,
3933,,Michael,Lucifer? What are you doing here?,
3934,,,Perfect. Troublemaker No.2.,
3935,,Lucifer,"Oh, Angel girl. Why did you wake up so late? You're already late for school~",
3936,,,"I already saw her from a distance. Honestly, it's really hard to ignore a blondie in pure white on the street.",
3937,,,She's a little too tidy and shiny for me.,
3938,,Michael,"… Sorry to disturb you, but it's already noon break, the classes this morning are all over now. And please don't call me that again.",
3939,,Lucifer,Huh?,
3940,,,So it's the bell for the end of class.,
3941,,Lucifer,"… That's fine by me, since I'm not in the mood for classes, I need to head back to my dorm.",
3942,,Michael,Wait... There are still classes in the afternoon.,
3943,,Lucifer,So what?,
3944,,Michael,… It's not good to skip class on your first day... I mean it's never good to skip classes no matter the time.,
3945,,Michael,You must go to class in the afternoon.,
3946,,Michael,"We still have some spare time before the next class begins, so let's just go to the Cafeteria for lunch together.",
3947,,Lucifer,"Nope, I don't think so.",
3948,,Michael,"Do you have other things to do?... Wait, there's something on your face. Is that blood?",
3949,,Lucifer,……,
3950,,,How did she notice that?,
3951,,Lucifer,It's just a scratch.,
3952,,,I slightly moved my position to block her from seeing the poker card in the wall.,
3953,,Michael,Really?,
3954,,Lucifer,Do you think I'd lie to you?,
3955,,Michael,"Fine, I believe you. But you should at least clean up the blood.",
3956,,,She takes out a handkerchief as she speaks--- a white one of course. Looks like she's trying to wipe the blood from my face.,
3957,,Lucifer,"… I don't need your help, back off.",
3958,,,"I ""dodged"" the approaching handkerchief and subtly pulled the card from the wall.",
3959,,Michael,Wait…,
3960,,,I leave before it's too late.,
3961,,Lucifer,(...There's no need to get her involved in this. The angel girl should just enjoy her normal life.),
3962,,Lucifer,(What happened on that day? What is D.E.F.? Why is that associated with me?),
3963,,Lucifer,(There are just too many things to find out...),
3964,,Lucifer,This is my room...,
3965,,,The room is dark because the light outside is blocked by the curtain. I didn't realize how messy this room was until this moment.,
3966,,Lucifer,"Well... Maybe I can clean up, in a few centuries.",
3967,,Lucifer,But if I'm really related to that D.E.F. association... There may be a clue in my room.,
3968,,Lucifer,I hope I didn't throw anything important away.,Start Searching
3969,,Lucifer,A notebook...,
3970,,Lucifer,There's nothing but doodles in it.,
3971,,Lucifer,... Why did I create this kind of stupid thing?,Keep Searching
3972,,Lucifer,Textbooks...,
3973,,Lucifer,Mainly teaches how to properly manage your mana.,
3974,,Lucifer,Why does it contain such simple information? I already knew that without having to learn it.,Keep Searching
3975,,Lucifer,Comic books...,
3976,,Lucifer,The story about a warrior's journey to defeat a demon. But why are there still so many pages after the demon's defeated?,
3977,,Lucifer,That's ridiculous.,
3978,,Lucifer,Must be by someone who cannot tell good stories.,
3979,,Lucifer,… But none of these books provide valuable information.,
3980,,Lucifer,"According to that bunny girl, I must be someone important in that association. How come I cannot find anything about it?",
3981,,,"After searching for a long time, I find out nothing.",
3982,,Lucifer,… But did I really always live somewhere this messy?,
3983,,Lucifer,………………,
3984,,Lucifer,Maybe not..,

3986,,Lucifer,…………,
3987,,Lucifer,Maybe the angel girl has this habit.,
3988,,Lucifer,Guess reading her journal won't matter...,
3989,,Lucifer,Maybe I should steal her journal from her dorm.,
3990,,Lucifer,No... This is not something I would do... I should directly steal it from her..,
3991,,Lucifer,And right now... I still have time to check before the afternoon class ends.,
3992,,Lucifer,Nothing can hide from me...,
3993,,Lucifer,This is gonna be interesting.,
3994,,,"A little while after Lucifer leaves, a black bat sneaks out from under the bed.",
3995,,,"And in no time at all, it transforms into a girl.",
3996,,Dracula,……,
3997,,Dracula,That was close! Why did she return so suddenly? I had to hide under her bed because of this!,
3998,,Dracula,But... This is the only way to retrieve the intel she was supposed to give weeks ago.,
3999,,Dracula,She also seemed to be looking for something... I hope Gambler didn't do anything stupid.,
4000,,Dracula,I think she said something before leaving... But I didn't hear her words clearly.,
4001,,Dracula,… Will she become a threat to our goals? Maybe we should recruit her again? She used to be one of us so it wouldn't be hard.,
4002,,Dracula,*Cough*... She hasn't even cleaned her room in ages. My dress is already dusty!,

4007,,Michael,"Yes, I am... I didn't mean to pretend to be sleeping.",

4014,,Raphael,Uh... Is there anything wrong with my face?,

4045,,Raphael,"Oh, you don't need to be naked. There's an opening in the back, you just need to loosen the string and turn around.",
4046,,Michael,I wish you told me this earlier.,
4047,,,"I easily find the knot, and pull a string to untie it.",
4048,,Raphael,Shall I start now?,
4049,,Michael,Please go on.,
4050,,,I didn't feel cold when Raphael touched the area between my wings. She must have warmed her hand before she started. Her thoughtfulness made me feel guilty for doubting her actual motivations.,
4051,,Raphael,……,
4052,,Michael,……,
4053,,Raphael,……,
4054,,Michael,Sorry to interrupt but... Have we finished yet?,
4055,,Raphael,Oh... We're done.,
4056,,Michael,Is there anything strange?,
4057,,Raphael,… There's something I'm trying to figure out. But you should be fine.,
4058,,Raphael,I suggest you come back here once a week... Bring Lucifer with you if possible.,
4059,,Michael,Is this about the dream Lucifer told you?,
4060,,Raphael,……,
4061,,Michael,I actually had the same dream.,
4062,,Raphael,… I can't tell right now. We need to do further research on that.,
4063,,Michael,… I understand. I'll try to bring Lucifer next time.,
4064,,Raphael,"Alright, your own clothes are in the locker room. Have a good rest today, there'll be class tomorrow.",
4065,,Raphael,"And, this is just a suggestion. Don't think about your former position too much.",
4066,,Michael,Do you mean the president of Discipline Committee...? Why?,
4067,,Raphael,You will feel more relieved without that title.,
4068,,Michael,Okay...,
4069,,Michael,It's time for me to leave. Thank you for your care these past few days.,
4070,,Raphael,（……）,
4071,,Raphael,(It's already been 5 minutes after Lucifer left...),
4072,,Raphael,"(She should've been several hundred meters away from Michael, but I still notice the mana flow inside Michael's body)",
4073,,Raphael,"(All I can conclude now is that their magic can influence each other, just like Esau & Jacob)",
4074,,Raphael,"(But the influence, it works differently...)",
4075,,Raphael,(Since they've already passed out once in the Test... It would be really dangerous to start another experiment...),
4076,,Raphael,(What happened to them?),
4077,,,*alarm clock sound*,
4078,,Michael,Emmm... Uh...,
4079,,,*alarm clock sound*,
4080,,Michael,Oh... It's already school time?,
4081,,,"I was woken up by the sound of the alarm clock, and the sunlight is already brightening my room--- it's 6:30 now.",Get up
4082,,Michael,Time to get up.,
4083,,,I rise from the bed and stretch my arms out.,
4084,,Michael,Oops...,
4085,,,"I happened to spread my wings out at the same time. Fortunately, they didn't hit anything in my room as everything else is placed far away from the bed.",
4086,,Michael,I must have foreseen this in the past.,Look around
4087,,,"The room is extremely tidy, I cannot find anything unnecessary placed here. The textbooks on the shelf have all been recently sorted…",
4088,,Michael,Thank god I wasn't a lazy person.,
4089,,Michael,There's still plenty of time before class... I can wash up first.,
4090,,,"Luckily, my daily clothes also have openings in the back for my wings, so I can take off the clothes easily.",
4091,,,"After that, it's time for a shower.",
4092,,Michael,…………,
4093,,,"Even if the water is lukewarm, it's still enough to lift my spirits.",
4094,,Michael,Uh... I've forgotten this.,
4095,,,"After my hair becomes wet, I start to worry about the feathers getting wet.",
4096,,,"But luckily, it seems that they're waterproof.",
4097,,Michael,"That's convenient, otherwise I'd have to dry my wings too... But the feathers still need a good brushing.",
4098,,,"So I start to enjoy the shower, and give myself a recap about what I know so far.",
4099,,Michael,… Lucifer.,
4100,,Michael,What's the relationship between her and me?,
4101,,Michael,"Same condition, same dream. Even Raphael asked me to bring her with me next time.",
4102,,Michael,This cannot be a coincidence.,
4103,,Michael,……,
4104,,Michael,"Well... Although she's not the type of person who is easy to get along with, there's no harm in trying.",
4105,,Michael,……,
4106,,Michael,This should be enough...,
4107,,,"It's time to finish my shower, but I find there's some additional work that needs to be done before I leave.",
4108,,Michael,… My feathers.,
4109,,Michael,"If I don't clean them up, they will definitely clog the drain.",Clean Up
4110,,,So I have to collect my dropped feathers one by one and put them inside a packet.,
4111,,Michael,"Okay, this will do.",
4112,,Michael,But I still wish I didn't shed feathers daily.,
4113,,,"After drying my hair and brushing my feathers, I'm fully ready for today's class.",
4114,,,I should admit it took me some time to put on the shirt as it's a little different from the pajamas.,
4115,,,"The opening area in the back is a bit different, because it also covers the part of my back between the wings.",
4116,,Michael,"It's a little complicated, but it's necessary to cover my back and keep me warm.",
4117,,Michael,"Oh, it's already seven. I should go now.",
4118,,Michael,Huh?,
4119,,,"When I try to sort out the textbooks I'll need for today's class, I find a brown bag, titled as ""Discipline Committee of Yume Academy"". There are also several pieces of paper on the table. Maybe I wasn't able to complete the file before losing my memory.",
4120,,Michael,Right... KongMing said that I was the president of the Discipline Committee.,
4121,,Michael,I must've been too tired to notice this yesterday...,
4122,,Michael,"...""Countermeasure and Prevention Plan for the Hidden Threats in the Academy"".",
4123,,Michael,I really wrote this? This doesn't seem to make any sense...,
4124,,Michael,……,Take a look
4125,,Michael,…………,
4126,,Michael,"No no no, I cannot do that. I'm no longer a Discipline Member.",
4127,,Michael,… I shall send it to Discipline Committee office.,
4128,,Student A,"Oh! President Michael, good morning.",
4129,,Michael,Morning~ But... I'm no longer the president so....,
4130,,Student A,Huh? Why?,
4131,,Michael,It's because...,
4132,,Student B,"President Michael, you finally decide to show up?",
4133,,Michael,"Haha... Good morning, but... Stop calling me president...",
4134,,Student C,PresidentMichael!Goodmorning!SorryfornotbeingabletogiveyouaformalgreetingbutI'mreallyinahurry!,
4135,,Michael,How many more times do I have to repeat that I'm no longer the president...,
4136,,Michael,"No, no. I'm a new student now...",
4137,,Michael,"Huh? No no no, I'm not here to check your dorm...",
4138,,Michael,…………,
4139,,Michael,*Gasp*... I never knew I was so popular in the Academy...,
4140,,Michael,"But... Even if I couldn't reach the cafeteria, at least I've arrived at the school building.",
4141,,？？？,"Oh, Michael?",
4142,,,The voice comes from behind me so I look back----,
4143,,,And find out that we're close enough to kiss each other goodbye.,
4144,,Michael,！？,
4145,,,It took me some effort to stop myself from flying away---,
4146,,？？？,"Wow, you're close enough you almost hit me with your wings!",
4147,,Michael,Uh... Sorry for that... And you are...?,
4148,,Hottie,"I'm your class teacher, Hottie. Call me whatever you want. Sorry, but I have this list to approach any girl that looks cute.",
4149,,Michael,H… Hottie?,
4150,,,"After calming myself down, I take a closer look at her. It's hard to tell who is prettier, she or doctor Raphael.",
4151,,,"But judging from her behavior after we met, I doubt she can handle the responsibilities of a teacher.",
4152,,Hottie,"KongMing has already told me about you. Don't worry, everyone in my class will treat you as a new student. You don't need to worry here.",
4153,,Michael,"… Thank you, Hottie.",
4154,,,Maybe she actually is a qualified teacher.,
4155,,Hottie,"And now it's time for you to introduce yourself. Come in, please.",
4156,,,Hottie leads me into the classroom as she speaks.,
4157,,？？？,…………,
4158,,？？？,…………,
4159,,,… It seems someone is surprised to see me here.,
4160,,Michael,(Of course there's someone who knows me... But it appears she/they have been informed beforehand...),
4161,,Hottie,*clears throat*  We've had many new classmates in this semester... I guess everyone wouldn't mind one more. It must be because of my charm that we attract so many cute students here...,
4162,,Michael,(It's embarassing to be stared by so many people...),
4163,,Michael,"(Still, I still need to make a self-introduction)",Introduce myself
4164,,Michael,"Hello, my name is Michael, as a new student on campus, I hope we can be friends in future.",
4165,,Michael,"Maybe you knew my former title before I lost my memory, but please don't think about that.",
4166,,Michael,"(Yeah, that should work...)",
4167,,Michael,(Hopefully),
4168,,,"Fortunately, my new classmates give me a warm welcome.",
4169,,Hottie,"Alright, Michael, take your seat over there.",
4170,,,"Hottie points at an empty seat in the last row of the 2nd line near the window. It seems the seats beside me are empty, but it's obvious that the one on my right is occupied as there are books on the desk.",
4171,,,I finally confirmed where the surprised looks are coming from. The two girls are sitting in my front and the right of my front... They also have wings. But only one for each.,
4172,,Hottie,Strange... There should be another new student today...,
4173,,Michael,(She must be talking about Lucifer. How can Lucifer be late on her first day?),
4174,,Michael,"(So, it's Lucifer that sits on my right?...)",
4175,,？？？,Sorry! I'm late!,
4176,,,"The girl that just came in has blonde hair and some red highlights--- Obviously, it's not Lucifer.",
4177,,,"She also has a pair of wings, neither white or black, they're golden.",
4178,,Hottie,"Phoenix, seriously? Again?... Guess you've gotten lost again? I'm almost starting to get used to it.",
4179,,Phoenix,……,
4180,,,"That Phoenix girl also seems surprised to see me here, but she recovers fast and takes her seat.",
4181,,Phoenix,"Good morning, Michael.",
4182,,Michael,… Good morning.,
4183,,Hottie,"Okay, class begins now.",
4184,,Michael,(The first class is finally over... I'm really hungry after missing breakfast）,
4185,,Phoenix,… Need one of these?,
4186,,Michael,What?,
4187,,,"Phoenix noticed my hunger, so she hands me a fresh riceball.",
4188,,Phoenix,"Just take it. Oh, it's cold, let me heat it up for you.",
4189,,Michael,"Uh, it's okay…",
4190,,,But Phoenix has already lit a bright fire in her hand...,
4191,,Michael,(This seems hot enough to burn the riceball into ashes),
4192,,Phoenix,Here.,
4193,,,"But surprisingly, the riceball isn't damaged after all after heating.",
4194,,,"Looks like Phoenix can properly wield her powers... Judging from her face, she's now waiting for a compliment",
4195,,Hottie,"Phoenix! Even if you're allowed to eat in the classroom, do not use fire in here!",
4196,,,"After saying that, Hottie hits Phoenix's head with her chalk.",
4197,,Phoenix,That hurt... I'm just trying to help Michael.,
4198,,,"Although Phoenix seems pretty embarrassed, she's still trying to explain.",
4199,,Phoenix,See? Hottie even allows us to eat in the classroom.,
4200,,Michael,I believe that's not what she meant...,
4201,,,"But when I turn to Hottie, she just shrugs her shoulders.",
4202,,Michael,"But, thanks anyway. I'll take it.",
4203,,Phoenix,"Oh, watch out for the steam when you open its pack.",
4204,,,"After opening the pack, the steam and smell of the riceball starts to leak out. But before I can take a bite, I feel someone staring at me.",
4205,,Phoenix,… (Stares),
4206,,Michael,…………,
4207,,,"I don't know if my instincts are wrong, but I feel like Phoenix is intentionally befriending. What she's doing is far more than just being nice to a new student...",Ask
4208,,Michael,"… Phoenix, is there anything I can help you with?",
4209,,Phoenix,…………,
4210,,Phoenix,I don't know if this is the best time...,
4211,,Michael,"Don't worry, just say it.",
4212,,Michael,(She must be here because of Discipline Committee issues),
4213,,Phoenix,President... I mean Michael. Do you know if the Discipline Committee has been after something recently?,
4214,,Phoenix,I'm not planning anything bad. I'm just a recruit of the Discipline Committee who's trying to help.,
4215,,,"Phoenix takes out a booklet as she speaks. ""Discipline Committee of Yume Academy"" is printed on the cover, which can be used as identification.",
4216,,Michael,"I see, but sorry to disappoint you. I've lost all my memories of the Discipline Committee...",
4217,,Phoenix,Okay... Sorry for bothering you.,
4218,,Michael,But...,
4219,,,I remember the files for Discipline Committee.,
4220,,Michael,"Since you're in the Discipline Committee, why don't you deliver this for me? You know, since I'm no longer the president.",
4221,,Phoenix,！！,
4222,,Phoenix,Okay! I'm going now!,
4223,,Michael,Wait... I think we should at least finish our morning classes.,
4224,,Phoenix,"Oh, yes, I almost forgot about those…",
4225,,,Phoenix seems very happy to get this file. I'm glad that the Discipline Committee can have such an energetic recruit.,
4226,,,"And finally, the morning classes are over.",
4227,,,"But obviously, Lucifer skips all the classes.",
4228,,Michael,(Raphael mentioned to bring Lucifer with me next time I go have a body exam…),
4229,,Michael,(Maybe I will reach out to her later),
4230,,Michael,"Phoenix, wanna have lunch with me?",
4231,,Phoenix,"Huh? Oh... Sorry, I'm in bit of a hurry... I need to hand this file to the Discipline Committee!",
4232,,Michael,Do you need to be in such a hurry?,
4233,,Phoenix,It may be something important! I don't think it's good to keep the other Discipline Members waiting.,
4234,,Michael,...Maybe just too energetic.,
4235,,Michael,(Guess I'll have to enjoy lunch alone),
4236,,,"But after I packed all my stuff in my school bag, the twins in front starts to stare at me.",
4237,,？？？,……,
4238,,？？？,……,
4239,,,"One of the twins is in pure white, the other one, full black, both are extremely cute. But I'm sure they don't share the same characteristics, one of them is calm, but the other one...",
4240,,,"...I don't know why, the one in white is about to cry.",
4241,,Michael,Uh... Hello?,
4242,,？？？,…………,
4243,,？？？,*Crys out* I'm soooooo sorry------,
4244,,？？？,"??? Sister, Wait!",
4245,,,"The girl in white runs away with tears, and her sister has no choice but to chase her after greeting me...",
4246,,Michael,Did I do anything horrible to them?,
4247,,,I never planned to bully anyone on my first day...,
4248,,Michael,Maybe I can sort this out with them later.,
4249,,Michael,Hopefully this issue can be settled soon.,
4250,,,"On my way to the Cafeteria, I notice there are two students outside the school building. On has a pair of bunny ears on her head, the other one has a pair of blackened wings on her back.",
4251,,Michael,It's Lucifer... I should remind her to attend school in the afternoon.,
4252,,Michael,"But, who is the other one? She doesn't look like a new student...",
4253,,Michael,"That doesn't matter, I will know that when I get there.",
4254,,Michael,Lucifer! What are you doing here?,
4255,,,"When I reach the students, I'm surprised to find Lucifer alone.",
4256,,,Lucifer turns to me as she hears me approaching.,
4257,,,… Ruffled hair and feathers. She must have just woken up.,
4258,,,She's not even properly dressed... But her outfit doesn't break the school rules at all. She must be a sting in the eye of the Discipline Committee.,
4259,,Lucifer,"Oh, Angel girl. Why did you wake up so late? You're already late for school~",
4260,,Michael,"… Sorry to disturb you, but it's already noon break, the classes this morning are all over now. And please don't call me that again.",
4261,,Lucifer,Huh?,
4262,,,Lucifer looks surprised.,
4263,,,… I don't know why she's surprised. Can she not tell the difference between morning and noon break?,
4264,,Lucifer,"… That's fine by me, since I'm not in the mood for classes, I need to head back to my dorm.",
4265,,Michael,Wait... There are still classes in the afternoon.,
4266,,Lucifer,So what?,
4267,,,This cannot be tolerated...,
4268,,,"Maybe it's my instincts from back when I was the president of the Discipline Committee, so I decided to take action.",
4269,,Michael,… It's not good to skip class on your first day... I mean it's never good to skip classes no matter the time.,
4270,,Michael,You must go to class in the afternoon.,
4271,,Michael,"We still have some spare time before the next class begins, so let's just go to the Cafeteria for lunch together.",
4272,,Lucifer,"Nope, I don't think so.",
4273,,Michael,"Do you have other things to do?... Wait, there's something on your face. Is that blood?",
4274,,,"When I am trying to think of an idea to convince her to attend class, I find some blood on her face.",
4275,,Lucifer,……,
4276,,Lucifer,It's just a scratch.,
4277,,,"Lucifer seems more nervous the more we speak, and she takes a step backward... She's trying to hide something from me.",
4278,,Michael,Really?,
4279,,Lucifer,Do you think I'd lie to you?,
4280,,Michael,"Fine, I believe you. But you should at least clean up the blood.",
4281,,,I take out a handkerchief as I speak--- so that I can have an excuse to get closer to that wound.,
4282,,Michael,(Not a scratch? But is that a stab? A cut wound? Or is it blood from another person?),
4283,,Lucifer,"… I don't need your help, back off.",
4284,,,"Lucifer takes a few steps backwards--- she almost hits the wall because of this, and suddenly flees.",
4285,,Michael,Wait…,
4286,,Michael,…………,
4287,,Michael,She just... Took a step to this direction intentionally.,
4288,,Michael,Is there anything on this wall?,
4289,,,After searching the wall... I find a thin but deep crack.,
4290,,Michael,Was this crack created by some kind of weapon? ... I can't tell.,
4291,,Michael,Lucifer must have taken it away.,
4292,,Michael,……,
4293,,,"As I'm trying to figure out an answer, I noticed something black near the wall.",
4294,,Michael,"… A black feather. It wasn't dropped naturally, it was cut by something extremely sharp.",
4295,,Michael,"It seems she was attacked by the girl with bunny ears, but I didn't see any weapons on her.",
4296,,Michael,"No matter what, all I can confirm now is that Lucifer got attacked.",
4297,,Michael,But why? She's already making rivals on her first day? That can't be possible...,
4298,,Michael,Then it must be about her past...,
4299,,Michael,Now that I think about it... I realize no one has ever talked about Lucifer's past in front of me.,
4300,,Michael,……,
4301,,Michael,That's something I need to worry about... I should report this to the Discipline Committee and let them solve this.,
4302,,Michael,It's no longer my responsibility.,
4303,,Michael,……,
4304,,Michael,No...,
4305,,Michael,Whether it's my duty or not…,
4306,,Michael,"Even if I'm no longer the person I was, even if I'm no longer the president of the Discipline Committee, it's still my job to...",
4307,,Michael,Maintain order and justice...,
4308,,,"Year 129, October 17 of New Calendar, Meeting Room of the Discipline Committee",
4309,,Phoenix,This is all I can remember.,
4310,,Phoenix,"And after that, I passed out.",
4311,,Joan,"I see... This is all what we need. Thank you for your cooperation, Phoenix.",
4312,,Joan,"And please don't tell any other students about our discussion, in case it causes a panic.",
4313,,Phoenix,I understand.,
4314,,Joan,"Thanks again, now please enjoy your school life. If you need my help, we'll be here.",
4315,,Joan,"By the way, are you enjoying the services here? You know, such as the dorm and the food...",
4316,,Phoenix,"Of course I am, it's far better than what I had during my journey.",
4317,,Phoenix,… I couldn't choose what to eat...,
4318,,Joan,"That's horrible... I know a Cafeteria that serves great dishes, maybe I can show you the way next time.",
4319,,Phoenix,Really? I'm looking forward to it...,
4320,,Joan,"Alright, it's about time. I still have a meeting to attend, so excuse me. And please take these desserts.",
4321,,Phoenix,……,
4322,,Joan,"...Phoenix, do you have anything else you want to ask? I can tell you everything I know.",
4323,,Phoenix,Joan... Does the Discipline Committee control the Academy?,
4324,,Joan,Not exactly. We only take care of campus security.,
4325,,Phoenix,… I see.,
4326,,Joan,Why do you ask?,
4327,,Phoenix,"Uh... President Joan, may I join you?",
4328,,Joan,"Huh? Of course you can. I mean, we'll be really happy to have an ex-valkyrie with us...",
4329,,Joan,But... May I ask why you want to join us?,
4330,,Phoenix,……,
4331,,Phoenix,"I've lost many friends during the war, I don't want to see that happen again.",
4332,,,"Year 129, October 22 of New Calendar, corridor of school building",
4333,,,I wasn't telling a lie.,
4334,,,But that's not the whole reason.,
4335,,Phoenix,Michael's unsubmitted file...,
4336,,Phoenix,"It should've been written before she lost her memory, but I should check it in case.",
4337,,Phoenix,… But I still feel like I failed Michael. I should apologize and give her some of the snacks from the Discipline Committee later.,
4338,,Phoenix,Sorry for that.,
4339,,Phoenix,……,
4340,,Phoenix,"Of course, nothing about Kratos is recorded.",
4341,,Phoenix,"Kratos's file is classified, even in the Discipline Committee. Not being able to find anything here is acceptable.",
4342,,Phoenix,Maybe I should find another way.,
4343,,Phoenix,Wait... These reports are...,
4344,,Phoenix,The records are from October 5th to 11th...,
4345,,Phoenix,"""October 5th, Senpai and Ithil seem to be planning something. Currently cannot confirm if it's dangerous. Further investigation suggested.""",

4347,,Phoenix,"""October 11th. Accident happened, aborting investigation.",
4348,,Phoenix,It suddenly ends.,
4349,,Phoenix,… I wonder what the accident was.,
4350,,Phoenix,Did Michael also heard that sound?,
4351,,Phoenix,… Ahhh... it's too late.,
4352,,Phoenix,I need to send this to the Discipline Committee before lunchtime is over.,
4353,,Phoenix,Uh... Where am I again? Which direction should I take to the Discipline Committee?,

4547,,*,…………,
4548,,*,I feel… so tired.,
4549,,Valeera,"Senpai, the encounter this time was quite dangerous.",
4550,,*,So… care to explain?,
4551,,Valeera,"Well… most of the pages from this book are smudged, so I can't tell in detail.",
4552,,Valeera,"Basically, the power surge in my library turned it into a Book Spirit.",
4553,,*,…So actually… this was your fault? I have never encountered such a strange Book Spirit.,
4554,,Valeera,…I take partial responsibility but if we need to blame. But the book being so special is also part of the reason!,
4555,,Valeera,"Although it turns normal now, it once held a strong magic inside.",
4556,,*,Like the type of magic that can pull us into its world?,
4557,,Valeera,That's right. This book was purposely created… But I've got no idea how it's created.,
4558,,Valeera,Ah! I can vaguely make out the writing of a name on the preface… Eggr…Eggret?,
4559,,*,(Eggret? The name sounds familiar… Oww…But my head is exploding when I try to think about this…),
4560,,Valeera,"Senpai, what's wrong?",
4561,,*,"… It's nothing, maybe I'm just tired.",
4562,,*,"Valeera… what are the ""tales"" told in this book?",
4563,,Valeera,"Oh, you get interested afterall?",
4564,,Valeera,They should be some interesting stories about the past?,
4565,,*,"But, the tales in this book… it seemed rather sad than fun.",
4566,,*,"Maybe someone hopes to keep records of these stories and thus wrote them into a tale, so that they would never be forgotten.",
4567,,Valeera,Never to be forgotten…,
4568,,Valeera,Senpai… It's not often that you say serious words.,
4569,,*,…Maybe I'm just really tired. I should probably rest.,
4570,,Valeera,"Okay, go ahead. I'll stay for a bit and find out more.",
4571,,*,"Yeah, see you around.",
4572,,Ragged Old Man,…………,
4573,,Ragged Old Man,…They really succeeded.,
4574,,Ragged Old Man,"They're surely not mages, but they're not ordinary either… Maybe they are of the same kind as the previous ones.",
4575,,Ragged Old Man,Hah! After decades of waiting! I'm free!,
4576,,Ragged Old Man,"But seems like I'm the only one left. Moreover, only a half of my soul still remains…",
4577,,Ragged Old Man,I wonder if my physical body still exists…,
4578,,Ragged Old Man,"At least, let me make my final contribution to this world.",
4579,,,"From that day forth, the book remained still and its eye shut, as if it was just an ordinary old book.",
4580,,,Its pages were decayed and tattered and only five stories remained intact.,
4581,,,"These pages were then cautiously and confidentially preserved, but somehow, soon enough, these tales rapidly spread all over campus.",

4585,,*,How… how did I get here? Was that… a dream?,
4586,,*,But what he said… and this place… doesn't seem familiar at all.,

4588,,*,I shall start by looking around.,
4589,,？？？,Tsk. What a blunder… Can't believe I'm stuck in a place like this.,
4590,,*,Hmm? Is there someone up ahead?,
4591,,？？？,"This place is about to collapse soon, better find Mio and find a way to escape…",
4592,,？？？,"If this was in the past, I could've easily… my powers are too weak now.",
4593,,*,(Mio…? The one up ahead knows Mio? Who could it be…?),Let me go check it out.

4602,,*,…………,Could…could it be… |Or am I speaking your language?
4603,,Rumpy,"…Okay, keep pretending as a normal cat is totally pointless. Seems like the ability to communicate with animals is permitted in this world.",
4604,,Rumpy,"Whatever, I guess it would be more convenient if you can understand me.",
4605,,Rumpy,"Oi, remember to follow my orders or we may never get out of here.","Uh… what? | Yes, captain!"
4606,,Rumpy,And you better get this straight.,
4607,,Rumpy,Cause sometimes I can't tell whether you're serious or joking but we're now in a serious situation.,
4608,,Rumpy,Mio should be here. So let's find her first… and… keep up.,
4609,,*,…………,
4610,,*,(Is this what Rumpy is really like?),
4611,Mio-2,*,Um… Where is Mio?,
4612,,Rumpy,"Mio's entry location is a slightly different to ours, she appears to have landed within a house.",
4613,,*,Why is that?,
4614,,Rumpy,"I'm just a cat, how would I know? You're expecting me to know all the answers?",
4615,,*,Could it be that… it has something to do with the legends.,
4616,,Rumpy,…Hah? What are you muttering about now? Legends?,I think I had a dream before… | There was an old man…
4617,,Rumpy,…Legendary stories…? So that's it…,
4618,,Rumpy,But… why…,
4619,,Passerby Girl,"Mama, mama, that person is talking to a cat!",
4620,,Passerby Mother,Stop staring at him! Come along now.,…I'm feeling mixed emotions about this.
4621,,Rumpy,(…Seems like only this moron understands me.),
4622,,Rumpy,"…Just listen and don't reply, in case people start suspecting us.","…(Nods) | Yes, captain!"
4623,,Rumpy,"My goodness, do you even get the situation you're in?",
4624,,Rumpy,Surely you still remember how you got in... Through that mysterious book...,
4625,,Rumpy,We have no knowledge about the book that pulled us in.,
4626,,Rumpy,We are currently in the world of the book and within one of its stories.,
4627,,Rumpy,"Of course, there're main characters for those stories, but for us… we are just playing the unnecessary roles, or even sitting under the stage.",
4628,,Rumpy,"And Mio, for some reason, she has become the main character of this story.",
4629,,Rumpy,"If what you said is true, the key to the exit lies with her…",(How does this cat know so much...) | So I'm not the main character.
4630,,Rumpy,…We're almost there.,
4631,Mio-3,Haughty Woman,What's wrong with you? Can't you even get a simple job done?,
4632,,Frivolous Woman,"And you're covered in dust! Don't even think about getting dust onto our clothing, Cinderella.",
4633,,Mio,"…Meow, fold clothes… How to even fold clothes meow…",
4634,,Haughty Woman,"Oh, what a clumsy fool!",
4635,,Frivolous Woman,"We'll be attending the royal ball tonight at the castle. Of course, you're not eligible to attend, you have neither the looks, attire nor shoes. Hahaha!",
4636,,Mio,Royal ball meow?,
4637,,Haughty Woman,"IF we're in a good mood, we might just bring some leftovers for you~ Hahahahahaha!",
4638,,Frivolous Woman,"Alright, sister, it's time for us to go fit on our gowns, any delay and we'll be covered in dust too.",
4639,,Mio,"What's going on, meow.",
4640,,Rumpy,…We're here.,
4641,,*,Mio is getting bullied...? Who are these people and who are they to her?,
4642,,Rumpy,"Don't fret, they're just characters in the story. No point getting upset over them.",
4643,,*,Characters in the story... You're saying that they aren't real?,
4644,,Rumpy,"…Maybe they were once upon a time, but now they've become a part of the story.",
4645,,*,…,
4646,,Rumpy,That might be the consequence of getting trapped here.,
4647,,*,Then we should hurry up and save Mio…!,
4648,,Rumpy,"Absolutely, I don't want to stay here for a second longer either.",
4649,,Rumpy,But we still don't know how this story will play out… rushing in headfirst would be a bad idea…,
4650,,Mio,Senpai! Rumpy!,
4651,,Rumpy,……,
4652,,*,Just now… did you feel it?,
4653,,Mio,…There's something coming meow.,
4654,,Chaos Creature,…………！！,
4655,,*,Chaos creatures!? Seriously!?,
4656,,Rumpy,…As expected.,
4657,,*,Have you found something?,
4658,,Rumpy,Deal with it first!,
4659,Mio-4,Mio,…Take this meow!,
4660,,Chaos Creature,Waaaahhhh…….,
4661,,*,It's gone… but something's off…,
4662,,Rumpy,It's as if no one's taken note of the commotion.,
4663,,*,But how could it be here…?,
4664,,Rumpy,…It's probably because Mio came into contact with us.,
4665,,*,…And what does that mean?,
4666,,Rumpy,"As the main character, Mio's actions will affect the developments of the story.",
4667,,Rumpy,"Our meeting with Mio has caused a deviation, or maybe the chaos creatures appeared to prevent us from doing so.",
4668,,*,"…So you're saying, we need to push the story?",
4669,,*,But how?... We don't even know the original storyline!,
4670,,Rumpy,We can only test it out.,
4671,,*,…Looks like it can't be helped.,
4672,,Mio,"Senpai, Rumpy… what are you guys talking about meow?",
4673,,*,"Oh, right… We haven't explained it to Mio…",Blah blah blah blah blah…
4674,,Mio,…...I see meow…,
4675,,*,So who were those two people?,
4676,,Mio,"I'm not sure, I met them when I woke up meow. I think they're my… sisters meow?",
4677,,Mio,"They're always giving me endless chores to do meow… But I get to sleep by the warm fire stove at night meow, it's very cozy.",
4678,,*,"The last part sounded quite… odd, are you sure they're your sisters?",
4679,,Rumpy,"…That's how the story goes, otherwise if every character is kind and loving, what story is there to tell?",
4680,,Rumpy,"Stop worrying about little things, our priority is to find the key to story development.",
4681,,*,The key…,I just overheard… | A ball?
4682,,Mio,Sisters said that they are… attending a royal ball at the castle meow.,
4683,,Rumpy,…Yes! That's it!,
4684,,*,That's… the key?,
4685,,Rumpy,Everything told in a story is significant… There must be something important about this…,
4686,,*,Then… do we need to attend the ball too?,
4687,,Rumpy,"…I think so, but it won't be easy.",
4688,,Mio,I think I remember the sisters said something about needing… what was it… to attend the ball meow.,You don't need anything | You need a cat | Clothes and shoes
4689,,Rumpy,Your memory's even worse than I thought.,
4690,,Rumpy,"You must be kidding, right?",
4691,,Rumpy,"That's right, didn't expect you to remember.",
4692,,Rumpy,Those two said that you need the correct attire and shoes.,
4693,,*,So what attire and shoes does one need to attend a ball?,
4694,,Rumpy,You're asking a cat for clothing advice? Seriously?,
4695,,*,But… I never learned this kind of knowledge…,
4696,,Rumpy,"Forget it, let's just see if we can find any clues around here.",
4697,,Mio,Umm… I've been dying to ask meow.,
4698,,*,Yes?,
4699,,Mio,"Senpai, how can you understand Rumpy?",
4700,,,Rumpy seemed to have winked at Mio before she continued to ask.,
4701,,Mio,…(Nods) I see meow.,
4702,,,…Feels like there's something I'm not getting told.,
4703,Mio-5,Rumpy,Ay! Where do you think you're going?,
4704,,*,"What do you mean ""where""? If we're looking for clothes and shoes, surely we should go to a clothing store?",
4705,,Rumpy,Did you even bring any money? Even a cat like me knows that you need to pay for everything you purchase…,
4706,,*,…No.,
4707,,Mio,…Neither did I meow.,
4708,,*,……,Then…what should we do?
4709,,Rumpy,…Strange… Something should occur in order for the story to progress at this point…,
4710,,,Bang!,！？
4711,,Mio,Meow! What happened?,
4712,,Town's Resident,Help! There's a monster!,
4713,,*,Again...!? Did we cause another deviation in the storyline?,
4714,,Rumpy,"No, It's not like the last one. The town's residence were unable to see it, but this one can be seen by everyone…",
4715,,Mio,"It's destroying everything, we have to stop it meow!",
4716,,*,Why the story seems to be leaving all the hard parts to us?!,
4717,,Mio,..It's finally over…,
4718,,Rumpy,"No other chaos creatures have appeared, seems like we're on the right track.",
4719,,*,So you're saying… the one from just now…,
4720,,Rumpy,"That's right, it's is supposed to appear in this story. But how could it fit into the storyline…?",
4721,,Man in Hood,"Greetings~ I saw the battle, truly remarkable I should say.",
4722,,Rumpy,(The stranger… is he also a part of the story?),Who are you?
4723,,Man in Hood,"Oh, I'm just a nameless mage.",
4724,,Man in Hood,But what's more important is that this town is in danger.,
4725,,Man in Hood,"As you can see, monsters like that have been appearing in town lately.",
4726,,Man in Hood,And I've recently noticed that something within that castle seems to be attracting them.,
4727,,*,The castle that's holding the ball?,
4728,,Man in Hood,"Exactly… I'm afraid, the people attending the royal ball might be in danger.",
4729,,*,Which also means…?,
4730,,Man in Hood,…I need your help.,
4731,Mio-6,Rumpy,…………,
4732,,Mio,…………,
4733,,Rumpy,What the… What have I turned into! What kind of magic is this!,
4734,,Mio,Meow…It's a dress…so uncomfortable meow.,
4735,,*,"So you created a gown and slippers with magic for us, so we can blend into the ball to prevent danger from happening…",
4736,,Rumpy,Even so! Why am I the horse carriage!? Why do you get to be the driver…,
4737,,Rumpy,This is humiliation… an absolute humiliation!,
4738,,*,"Well… after all, it is a ball and you'd need an identity cover.",
4739,,Rumpy,"You mark my words! Once we've escaped, I better get treated with pedigree catfood!",
4740,,*,(That's it? That was pretty easy…),
4741,,Rumpy,Why can't he do it himself? And what's up with the cheap tricks? I really want to scratch and tear up that hood…,
4742,,*,Quite suspicious indeed…,
4743,,Man in Hood,"My magic won't last long… so be sure to leave before the clock strikes 12 for midnight, the ball should end by then.",

4878,,Priestess,…I would like to ask the same.,
4879,,Priestess,Well… I originally came in for Senpai.,
4880,,Priestess,But this meeting was not scripted within the story… so the storyline must've been disrupted. What should we do…,
4881,,Priestess,"Senpai, you'll have to take responsibility.",
4882,,*,"Wait wait wait…a minute, what's going on? And how do you know so much? Can you please explain…?",
4883,,Priestess,Before that…,
4884,,*,Wh…what?,
4885,,Chaos Creature,…………！！,
4886,,Priestess,We need to banish these uninvited guests first…!,
4887,,*,Why… why did chaos creatures suddenly appear…? And…why does nobody seem to notice?,
4888,,Priestess,"Let's start from the beginning, do you still remember the mysterious book?",
4889,,*,The book that pulled me in here right?,
4890,,Priestess,"Yes, I accidentally came across the book during my meditation…",
4891,,Priestess,"At that time not much magic remained in the book. But apart from Senpai, five others were also assaulted by it and left laying unconscious.",Five others? | Unconscious?
4892,,Priestess,"Succuba, Mio, Wraith, Lucifer, Michael… none of them suffered physical damage, but their consciousness were unable to recover.",
4893,,*,But we're in this world now… and sober… which means that only our consciousness has come to this world?,
4894,,Priestess,"Exactly, and according to Valeera, to escape this world...",
4895,,*,We must complete the story?,
4896,,Priestess,"As expected of Senpai, you already know.",I had a dream before… | There was an old man…
4897,,Priestess,So that's how it is. There are still people who have their consciousness in this world.,
4898,,Priestess,"As I didn't know where everyone else was, I had to check everywhere, and ended up here.",The chaos creature from just now…
4899,,Priestess,"In order to complete the story, we need follow the right track of it… If we make any mistakes, I'm afraid consequences may occur.",
4900,,*,Like the appearance of those chaos creatures...?,
4901,,*,But… all we did was meet up…,
4902,,Priestess,That's already the biggest deviation.,
4903,,*,What…?,
4904,,Priestess,"In the original story… Princess Kaguya never revealed her face to outsiders, at least in the beginning part of the story.",
4905,,Priestess,"The first meeting with an outsider was after she had set five impossible tasks for her suitors… in which the last suitor, the emperor met through unforeseen circumstances.",
4906,,Priestess,"After you climbed over the wall and met me, you've overwritten the storyline, senpai…",
4907,,Priestess,"In other words… you've now taken over an original role. You've become my final suitor, the emperor.",
4908,,*,！？,
4909,Priestess-3,Priestess,"…At this point, the storyline has deviated to the point where it's irreversible.",
4910,,Priestess,Under such circumstance… chaos creatures could appear anytime.,
4911,,*,Then… what should we do?,
4912,,Priestess,"There are still many suitors outside, I'm afraid I can't just ignore them and move on with the story…",
4913,,Priestess,But there's also no time to set up five impossible tasks and wait in patience…,Five difficult tasks…?
4914,,Priestess,"The stone bowl of the Buddha, a jeweled branch, the legendary robe of the fire rat, a colored jewel from a dragon's neck and a cowry shell born from a swallow...",
4915,,Priestess,"Even with the story shortened, I don't know if it will hold up in its current state…",I have an idea… | How about turning these five tasks into one?
4916,,Priestess,…………,
4917,,Priestess,Turning five tasks into one?,
4918,,Priestess,"Well… the content of the task doesn't actually matter, does it?",
4919,,Priestess,"I see… Senpai, you always have a solution…",
4920,,Priestess,"It's probably pushing it, but we could give it a try.",
4921,,Priestess,"Father, please bring all the suitors before me.",
4922,,Hunchback Old Man,"Oh, are you finally going to agree? But… who are you going to choose? There're 5 suitors out there.",
4923,,Priestess,I have a difficult task for them… only the one who can solve it may become my husband.,
4924,,Hunchback Old Man,"I see…That's right, that's the only way you can choose the right suitor. Then I will see them in right away.",
4925,,Wealthy-looking Man,"Finally… Princess Kaguya looks beautiful as rumored… but, what could the difficult task entail?",
4926,,Priestess,Oh… it's actually very simple.,
4927,,Priestess,The task is to defeat me in battle.,
4928,,Priestess,"(As expected, we've deviated from the storyline...)",
4929,,Chaos Creature,…………！！,
4930,,Wealthy-looking Man,"But… but I don't want to hurt you, Princess.",
4931,,Priestess,"Then, will you give up instead?",
4932,,Wealthy-looking Man,"Since you give me no choice, I will have to take you on…!",
4933,,Priestess,(Fighting against chaos creatures while fighting against these suitors… and I have to try not to hurt them by accident.),
4934,,Priestess,Phew… It's over.,
4935,,Wealthy-looking Man,How… how can it be?,
4936,,Wealthy-looking Man,…Princess Kaguya is not only of magnificent beauty but also of great strength…!,
4937,,Wealthy-looking Man,"Absolutely charming… I, I will not give up on my proposal. I will come back again, Princess.",
4938,,*,…Why does it feel like it's becoming more troublesome?,
4939,,Priestess,"Anyways, there won't be a next time. The story is progressing to its next phase.",
4940,,Priestess,"Once the full moon arises, celestial beings will come to take me back to the moon.",
4941,,*,Celestial beings…?,
4942,,Priestess,It's hard to believe… but that's how the story records.,
4943,,Priestess,"But if it's true… it would be really interesting. Anways, we'll soon find out.",
4944,Priestess-4,,"…And we thought we would wait for days or even months… but surprisingly on that night, a bright full moon was already visible in the sky.",
4945,,*,It's already a full moon tonight…?,
4946,,Priestess,…It should still be days away.,
4947,,Priestess,"The sole purpose for this world's existence is to complete the story, as soons as one scene is completed, the passing of time will be sped up to the next one.",
4948,,Priestess,Well… it's time to get ready to meet the celestial beings.,
4949,,,"As the moon lit up the nightsky, clouds gathered as if they were alive and slowly descended towards the ground.",
4950,,*,So these are the celestial beings huh…?,
4951,,,"As the clouds grew nearer and vision became clearer of what was above the clouds, immediately curiousity faded to uneasiness.",
4952,,*,Celestial beings… are…chaos creatures…!?,
4953,,Priestess,… I see.,
4954,,Priestess,…Celestial beings are beyond human understanding.,
4955,,Priestess,To play out a role that one cannot comprehend over a long period seems too hard for anyone…,
4956,,Priestess,This world has existed for a long time… I guess the results were inevitable.,
4957,,Priestess,"Unfortunately, there's still one more mystery to be solved.",
4958,,Priestess,"Looks like we'll have to find our own way up to the sky...after we get rid of these creatures, of course.",
4959,,*,It's over...but how can we get to the sky?,
4960,,*,"You don't know how to fly, do you? No, even for students who can fly, they won't reach that height.",
4961,,Priestess,"…If Valeera remembered correctly from one of the incomplete stories within the book, there was another way to reach the clouds.",
4962,,Priestess,"As for now, we can only test out that theory.",
4963,,,Priestess took out a bean and planted it into the ground.,
4964,,,"As soon as the beans were buried, they immediately sprouted from the ground. It definitely wasn't the growth speed any ordinary plant can have.",
4965,,*,Wh…what is this!?,
4966,,,"But what happened next was even more bizarre and terrifying. Within seconds, the beanstalk sprouted wildly in all directions, rooting further underground.",
4967,,,"Thereafter, green vines began to intertwine, reaching towards the sky, expanding and forming a giant green tower.",
4968,,Priestess,…Looks like Valeera's theory is correct afterall.,
4969,,Priestess,"This was a technique of scattering seeds into soldiers… but in this world, due to intertwining storylines, it caused an unexpected effect.",
4970,,Priestess,"If I had the time, I would have liked to meditate here for a while…",
4971,,Priestess,"But our priority is to escape from here. Come on, Senpai, let's see the world beyond the clouds.",
4972,,*,Let's go.,
4973,,,"Grasping Priestess' outstretched hand, the two headed up the green tower, towards the sky.",
4974,Priestess-5,*,…………,
4975,,,"After a long way up, the green vines became thinner and thinner and impossible to climb any further, we finally stepped onto solid ""ground"".",
4976,,,Only that the ground was made up of white clouds.,
4977,,,The scenery was amazing.,
4978,,*,……！！？？,
4979,,Priestess,Guess… this is the hometown of Princess Kaguya.,
4980,,*,But…there's absolutely nothing besides the moon and the sky.,
4981,,Priestess,Maybe the person who created this world also has no idea about how the heavens look like.,
4982,,*,"But strange…We're already reached the sky, yet the story hasn't ended…",
4983,,*,"Is it because Princess Kaguya's hometown is actually on the moon? But the vines can only reach this high, how can we get to the moon?",
4984,,Priestess,"No, it's not that…",
4985,,Priestess,"If I remember correctly, the story doesn't say that Princess Kaguya reached the moon.",
4986,,Priestess,Princess Kaguya put on a feather robe and aboarded a flying vehicle that soared through the sky…,
4987,,Priestess,"At the end of the story, the sad emperor went to the mountain top nearest to heaven and burned the elixir of eternity, hoping that it's eternal smoke would reach the moon…",
4988,,Priestess,"But, he was never able to see Princess Kaguya again and died of grief.",
4989,,*,So that means…,
4990,,Priestess,"Senpai, you're currently the emperor in the story and we're still here together…",
4991,,*,"Which means I shouldn't be up here, right?",
4992,,Priestess,Correct.,
4993,,Priestess,"This is a pill of medicine I made… Althought it's not the elixir of life , but it should be good enough for the story to progress.",
4994,,*,I see…,
4995,,*,"I'll find the highest mountain top, burn the elixir of life, then our story should be complete.",
4996,,*,……,
4997,,Priestess,"What's wrong, Senpai?",
4998,,Priestess,Are you sad to part ways?,
4999,,Priestess,"It's just a story, it's not real…",It just that it's such a sad story…
5000,,Priestess,It is…,
5001,,,The return trip from the clouds along the vines and landing onto ground to burning the pill on the highest mountain top went without a hitch.,
5002,,,"Soon after, white smoke reached towards the sky, but before it could reach the clouds, it had already dispersed into its surrounding atmosphere, let alone reaching the moon.",
5003,,,"Looking up towards the sky and the moon, and for the first time the sky felt so far away.",
5004,,,But… at least I know Priestess is still waiting for me.,
5005,,Priestess,…The smoke is rising. Senpai has already burned my pill.,
5006,,Priestess,Luckily it's me who came into this story… The others won't feel it this easy.,
5007,,Priestess,"Plus, what's more important is…",
5008,,Priestess,The person that wrote this legend…Who could he be?,
5009,,Priestess,"…And the princess that came from the sky and returned, whom is rumored to be as beautiful as the moon.",
5010,,Priestess,"…Maybe, we'll get the chance to meet each other someday.",
5011,,,"A strong piercing light appeared and soon enough, the moon and the clouds disappeared within.",
10000005,A sentence,Priestess,"Then there's no need for me to further explain. In any case, I have made preparations on the outside and arrived to help you.",

5068,,Succuba,"Oh, this? It has bread and red wine in it… Who knows what it's for? It was in my hand when I woke…",
5069,,Succuba,"Ummm… I think I'm meant to bring it to some cottage in the woods, but… Oh well, it's not important anyways.",
5070,,*,(That's it! That's the key to completing the story!),
5071,,*,"Then…then let's take the basket to the cottage together! After that, we can look for a place to rest...",
5072,,Succuba,No.,
5073,,*,...Why?,
5074,,Succuba,"Master just wants to get out of here so that he can escape from me, right?",
5075,,Succuba,Ah ah ah ah ah… Don't think that I can't tell.,
5076,,Succuba,You can ask me to do anything... but escaping is not an option...,
5077,,*,………………,
5078,,*,(I better think of a plan to distract Succuba so that I can go find some clues at the cottage… …),
5079,,*,"Um… Succuba, I'm feeling a bit thirsty… Maybe there is water nearby, do you think you could bring me some water to drink?",
5080,,Succuba,"Can't you just drink some red wine? Or you can even drink my blood, ah ah ah ah ah…",
5081,,*,"No no, I'm not good with wine… nor can I drink blood, I don't want to see you get hurt.",
5082,,Succuba,"Oh master, you're so sweet~",
5083,,*,"Because… you see, if I don't drink water, then my blood will reduce.",
5084,,*,I want to give you my blood… but my body wouldn't be able to bear it right now.,
5085,,*,Once you've brought me some water… Then I'll give you as much blood as you want!,
5086,,Succuba,Rea…really?,
5087,,*,Of course! How could I lie to you!,
5088,,Succuba,Okay then~ I'll be right back!,
5089,,Succuba,You promise... you won't escape?,
5090,,*,I promise I won't!,
5091,,Succuba,Ah ah ah… Master's TASTY blood… I can't wait! Ah ah ah ah….,
5092,,*,……,
5093,,*,…… RUN!!,
5094,Succuba-4,*,Phew… Think I've gotten away.,
5095,,*,I think this is the cottage that Succuba spoke about.,
5096,,*,There should be someone inside…,
5097,,,Knock knock.,
5098,,Grandma,Who's there?,
5099,,*,I… I lost my way and was hoping to have a place to stay…,
5100,,Grandma,"Oh, poor child. Come in, come in.",
5101,,*,Thank you very much…,
5102,,*,(It looks like a plain old cottage… Will I find my next clue here?),
5103,,Grandma,"You must be tired from wandering in the woods. Here, have something to eat.",
5104,,*,Thank you…,
5105,,*,Do you stay on your own?,
5106,,Grandma,"Yes, my dear, but I do often have a visitor.",
5107,,Grandma,"My granddaughter, oh, she loves the red cape I've given her. She wears it so often that people call her Little Red Riding Hood.",
5108,,Grandma,"She should be bringing me red wine and bread today… But for some reason, she's taken longer than usual, I wonder if she's gotten lost in the woods?",
5109,,*,(That is probably Succuba's character in this story.),
5110,,*,I'm sure she will be here soon.,
5111,,Grandma,"Oh, you're such a lovely young boy.",
5112,,Grandma,"Oh no, maybe she ran into the Big Bad Wolf…",
5113,,*,"Oh no, maybe she ran into the Big Bad Wolf…",
5114,,Grandma,"Yes, he's a cunning one alright, always tricking and gobbling people up…",
5115,,*,How… how scary…,
5116,,*,…,
5117,,*,(I vaguely remember a story from the library that had a similar tale…),
5118,,*,"(A little girl was tricked by the Big Bad Wolf and took a detour through the woods, even revealing her grandmother's cottage.)",
5119,,*,(The Big Bad Wolf then took the opportunity and arrived at the grandmother's cottage first where he waited for the little girl.),
5120,,*,(Is that the same story as this one?),
5121,,*,…But I haven't come across the Big Bad Wolf…,
5122,,*,"Ever since I tricked Succuba and escaped to the cottage,  the story development has been running smoothly…",
5123,,*,……,
5124,,*,Wait a minute… So my character is…,
5125,,*,AHAHAHA…! Can't be!,
5126,,Succuba,"Master~! So you were here all along! Finally, I found you…",
5127,,*,…………………………,
5128,,Succuba,"Ah ah ah… master, how could you lie to me and escape…",
5129,,*,I…I'm sorry!,
5130,,Succuba,I searched for soooooo long in the woods and finally realized that you might be here…,
5131,,Succuba,But I'm so nice to you… Why would you lie to me and run away?,
5132,,Succuba,Why why why WHY WHY!,
5133,,*,L-l-l-l-…let me explain…,
5134,,Succuba,Ah ah ah ah ah…. Master needs to receive a little punishment…!,
5135,,Succuba,"Let's see, how about I start by…drinking your blood!",
5136,,*,(I guess… the ending to that story was… how the Big Bad Wolf was killed…),
5137,,,"But before I could even recall, the scenery before me rapidly faded as a stinging pain seared from my neck and a white light appeared and swallowed the scene.",
5138,,,"Although the process was a bit strange, the story finally came to an end....",
5139,,,And then a sudden thought occurred as my consciousness was slowly fading away.,
5140,,,It really is... bad to lie…,

5142,,*,What's happening…? Am I in a dream?,
5143,,*,Where am I?,
5144,,*,A forest… close to Yume Academy? There's the sound of water…,

5146,,*,"What a big lake… It's definitely not near the academy, I've never seen anything like this before.",
5147,,*,Hmm? I think there's someone around…?,
5148,,Lucifer,Fool… Why didn't you just run away instead?,
5149,,Lucifer,"If you had left me and gone to get help, we might've been saved by now.",
5150,,Lucifer,"Now look, we're both trapped in here, who else is going to know we're here?",
5151,,Michael,I guess… You do have a point…,
5152,,Michael,But I can't just stand and watch when someone's in need.,
5153,,Lucifer,"Urgh, you're such a goody two-shoes, I can't stand it.",
5154,,*,Lucifer? Michael? You're here too?,
5155,,Michael,Thank God! We're not the only ones here!,
5156,,Lucifer,There's no need to get happy. Of what use can he bring?,
5157,,*,"…I'm still here, you know…",
5158,,Michael,Don't mind...we're not any better than you now...,
5159,,Michael,"By the way, were you also sucked in by a mysterious book?",
5160,,*,"As expected, you were too.",
5161,,Michael,I witnessed Lucifer getting attacked by the book and jumped in to save her but got myself sucked in too instead.,
5162,,Michael,"Anyways, does Senpai know where we are or how we can get out?",I think I had a dream before… | There was an old man…
5163,,Michael,"""Complete the story…?"" What does that mean…",
5164,,Lucifer,For a simpleton… you expect me to believe in your nonsense?,
5165,,Michael,There's no other way currently so we should give it a try.,
5166,,Lucifer,Whatever then.,
5167,,Michael,Hmm… Where should we start?,
5168,,,"As Michael ponders, she walks towards the lake.",
5169,,Michael,…What's going on?,

5171,,Michael,Look…,
5172,,,"Michael stood at the edge of the lake, looking surprised as she points down at the water beneath her feet.",
5173,,,The reflection upon the water was of Lucifer.,
5174,,Michael,Is this some type of magic? But… why Lucifer…,
5175,,Lucifer,"Hah, let me see.",
5176,,,"Lucifer walks towards the lake, but the reflection in the water was of Michael.",
5177,,Lucifer,……,
5178,,Lucifer,"…Strange, what kind of prank is this? Ay you, come over here!",Walk towards the lake.
5179,,,"As I walked towards the lake and looked down into the water, wondering what I would see…",
5180,,,The water instead reflected nothing as if there were nothing standing above it.,

5182,,Michael,Senpai…?,
5183,,Lucifer,"Oi, you're not a ghost of some sort, are you?",
5184,,*,"Wait, wait, wait… Why am I the problem? All of the reflections were strange, the problem is clearly this lake.",
5185,,Michael,"Indeed... So, if we want to finish the story, all we have to do is figure out the secret of the lake?",
5186,,*,"Yes, I suppose…?",
5187,,Lucifer,What the.......that's just lame. I'm not going to play this silly detective game with you.,
5188,,Lucifer,"I'm going to nap on the side, call me when you actually discover something!",
5189,,Michael,"Urgh, when is she going to change that bad attitude of hers.",
5190,,Michael,"There's nothing we can do, Senpai, guess there's only you and me left to solve this mystery.",Yep.|Let's see what we can find out.
5191,,Michael,"So… my reflection is Lucifer, her reflection is of me and Senpai doesn't have a reflection at all.",
5192,,Michael,"If it's because Lucifer and I can fuse into Nephilim, then…",
5193,,Michael,Then why doesn't Senpai have a reflection at all?,Because I'm a ghost.
5194,,Michael,"Senpai, it's not the time to be joking around.",
5195,,Michael,If only we had one more person to make sure.,
5196,,Michael,Hmm? Feels like we're surrounded by something.,
5197,,Chaos Creature,…………！！,

5225,,Lucifer,It's endless… …,
5226,,*,"Lucifer, Michael, if we don't complete the story, they'll just keep coming!",
5227,,Lucifer,"Then tell me what's next! This story isn't going to end up with us all dying here, is it?",
5228,,*,(There must be some kind of reason for Lucifer and Michael to enter this story together...),

5241,,Michael,"Ow, my head hurts… what's going on!?",
5242,,Lucifer,We failed… you are too distracted…,
5243,,Michael,I'm concentrating very hard! You're the one thinking about other things!,
5244,,,"At this moment, I started noticing something strange.",
5245,,*,Look! Something's going on in the lake!,
5246,,,Both of their reflections were no longer of each other but have now entangled into a shapeless reflection.,
5247,,,"The two reflections attracted and repelled each other in the vortex, unable to form a stable shape.",
5248,,Lucifer,…What is this?,
5249,,Michael,Is it trying to foretell something?,

5251,,*,……,Leave this to me! | Hurry and get to the center of the lake.

5253,,*,"It's fine, it seems that I'm not the main character of this story.",
5254,,*,"I can hold off for awhile,  as soon as you guys can find the conclusion to the story, we can leave.",
5255,,Michael,Senpai…,
5256,,Lucifer,I'm not one to run away from a fight.,
5257,,Michael,Just this once…,
5258,,Lucifer,"Don't die, or she won't quit talking about it.",
5259,,*,"Why would I, I'm still full of energy.",
5260,,Lucifer,"Then, good. Goody two-shoes, can you still fly?",
5261,,Michael,"Of course, I can still muster the last energy.",
5262,,Lucifer,Good. I was wondering how I was going to fly while holding you.,
5263,,Michael,For real……,
5264,Nephilim-5,,A pair of white and a pair of black wings both spread out and flew towards the center of the lake.,
5265,,Michael,I can see it clearly from here…that shapeless form in the lake is our reflection.,
5266,,Lucifer,"The conclusion to the story… until now, besides the lake that's different, we haven't gotten any other clues.",
5267,,Lucifer,"Even if we attack the lake, it would just stir up water splashes, like any other lake would.",
5268,,Michael,What exactly.......should we do?,
5269,,Lucifer,"If this world is about someone's story, then we're in the same situation as that person, right?",
5270,,Michael,"Yes, I think so.",
5271,,Lucifer,"Surrounded by chaos creatures and forced towards the lake… If we couldn't fly, there might've only been one option.",
5272,,Michael,That is…?,
5273,,Lucifer,"Jump into the lake, since it have come down to our last resort.",
5274,,Michael,You want us to jump into this strange lake? We don't even know what could be down there…,
5275,,Lucifer,"By the time you figure it out, that fool on the ground will be dead already. Or are you scared?",
5276,,Michael,Umm…,
5277,,Lucifer,Then I'll go first.,
5278,,Michael,You… you! Wait…wait for me!,
5279,,,"The white and black reflection then rushed into the lake, shattering its mirror-like surface into countless splatters.",
5280,,,Beneath the surface of the water were shards and countless glowing particles floating up from the depths of the lake.,
5281,,,"And as Michael and Lucifer dived futher in depth, they felt as if they had become one with the particle of light.",
5282,,,"It was not the first time they had come across this scenery. Within a deep dream, they moved like this, heading forward in a river of light.",
5283,,,"As they approached the source of light, they transformed into golden and black, distinct but intertwined particles of light.",
5284,,,"If they had continued to move forward, they may have been able to return to that river of light, back to their original forms.",

5286,,*,…Huff…huff… Are they still not done yet?,
5287,,,"On the banks, I was still struggling to defeat chaos creatures and noticed that Lucifer and Michael entered the lake but were slow to return.",

5294,,*,……? This place is…,

5296,,*,But… it's not Yume Forest… There are strange plants everywhere. I wonder what place is this?,
5297,,*,"… The old man said ""complete the story.""",
5298,,*,It looks like the only thing here that has a story to tell is that castle.,

5308,,*,Uh…sure.,
5309,,*,"（Wow, he sure is friendly.)",
5310,,Man in Armor,We're inside the castle… Where do you think the monster is hidden?,
5311,,*,Umm… What type of monster is it?,
5312,,Man in Armor,"I'm not too certain either, some say it's an ancient zombie, others say its an evil vampire.",
5313,,Man in Armor,It was even said to be a young woman with skin as white as snow… but unfortunately we don't know whether this is true or story.,
5314,,Man in Armor,"Although most people are here due to these rumors, hahaha!",
5315,,Man in Armor,"No matter what it is, as long as it's not a ghost or some sort, I should be able to take them on. I'm really terrified of them, you see.",

5334,,Wraith,Was Senpai also attacked by that book?,
5335,,*,"Yes, and we need to complete the story in order to escape.",
5336,,Wraith,Complete the story… Then what do we need to do?,
5337,,*,From the current situation… it seems that you're the owner of this castle.,
5338,,Wraith,Then all I need to do is scare off people right? Oo-o-o-oh… I LOVE this job!,
5339,,*,I don't think that's it.,
5340,,Wraith,…WAH!,
5341,,*,AAARGGGHHH! Don't scare people at a time like this!,
5342,,Wraith,I was just practicing my role… Hmm~ Seems like it worked.,
5343,,*,Felt like my heart stopped beating…,
5344,,*,But I don't think this story is that simple… Are there any strange places in this castle?,
5345,,Wraith,"Mmm… If that's the case, then there's a dining table filled with all sorts of food on it in the castle.",
5346,,Wraith,"But beware not to eat any of it, Senpai.",
5347,,*,Why is that?,
5348,,Wraith,They're probably enchanted or cursed.,

5351,,Wraith,Well… Am I really?,

5355,,*,An apple…but why has it been bitten? Did she take a bite?,
5356,,Wraith,Oo-o-o-oh… Here comes a crowd of people outside and ones that are easily frightened too… It hasn't been this much fun in a long time!,
5357,,Wraith,Everyone at Yume Academy has already been spooked… Nobody gives a good reaction anymore.,
5358,,*,What kind of people have arrived outside?,
5359,,Wraith,"All sorts of people, but they've all come with weapons saying something about wanting to vanquish the monster…",
5360,,Wraith,"It shouldn't have anything to do with me, plus they're all turning back…",
5361,,*,(…Why does it seem like they're coming for you?),

5369,,*,This doesn't seem right…,
5370,Wraith-4,Wraith,"Oh no, what should I do now…",
5371,,Wraith,"There are too many people, it's impossible to scare them all at once.",
5372,,Wraith,They're heading towards us… what should we do?,
5373,,Wraith,"Oo-o-o-oh, I haven't done anything bad, have I? All I've done is give them a good scare…",
5374,,*,…This is probably just a part of the story.,
5375,,Wraith,"But, if this goes on… we'll be caught!",
5376,,*,We need to figure out how this story will end.,
5377,,*,…………,

5379,,Wraith,Yep.,
5380,,*,Then…,
5381,,*,The first person I encountered had also just woken up from sleep.,
5382,,*,And why did so many people only come after Wraith had woken up?,
5383,,*,Even the timing of the plants retreating were roughly at the same time.,
5384,,*,Is all of this connected to her awakening?,
5385,,Angry Crowd,Where is the monster? Where is she hiding!,
5386,,*,…Let's first hide somewhere in the Castle! Head to the coffin where you woke up!,

5390,,Wraith,What?,
5391,,,It's such an elegant and richly decorated black coffin.,
5392,,,"The inside of the coffin was empty besides its soft covered cushions. The lid of the coffin was opened on its side, which must have been when Wraith pushed it open to get out.",
5393,,,"Examining the lid of the coffin carefully, an exquisite carving of a bat was found.",
5394,,*,A bat…,
5395,Wraith-5,Wraith,Senpai… what are we doing here?,
5396,,*,I think I might have a lead…,
5397,,*,"Just to be sure again, you didn't bite into the apple, did you?",
5398,,Wraith,It was like that when I woke up already.,
5399,,*,Do you know what happens if you eat it?,
5400,,Wraith,Well… I can only detect some kind of enchantment or curse on it… But it's not strong.,
5401,,Wraith,"If an ordinary person ate it, they could probably lose their life… but if I were to eat it… I would probably just be unconscious for awhile.",
5402,,Wraith,"Senpai… Are you feeling hungry? I can go find other food for you, you don't have to force yourself to eat this…",
5403,,*,"No no no, plus I wouldn't eat that kind of thing…",
5404,,*,"But… we might need you to eat it, Wraith.",
5405,,Wraith,Me!?,
5406,,Wraith,Wh..Why?,
5407,,*,"From what I can deduce, everything is linked to the owner of this castle and that would mean you.",
5408,,*,"When you were in deep slumber, everyone within the castle also fell into a deep sleep, and thorns grew thick surrounding the castle, keeping people away.",
5409,,Wraith,Like… a kind of barrier?,
5410,,*,"Once you awoke, the effects gradually faded causing the people to come to the castle…",
5411,,Wraith,So they can… vanquish me?,
5412,,*,That's right…,
5413,,Wraith,"But why? All I did was chase them away, I didn't do anything bad.",
5414,,*,Umm…,
5415,,*,Maybe the main character of this story thought the same way.,
5416,,*,"As long as you are awake, you will attract an endless stream of people coming to vanquish you.",
5417,,Wraith,And that's why she chose to enter a coffin and fall into a deep slumber?,
5418,,*,I'm afraid so.,
5419,,Wraith,…………,
5420,,Wraith,I get it then… So all I have to do is go back into my slumber?,
5421,,Wraith,It feels so sad and lonely.,"Don't worry, I'm right here beside you."
5422,,Wraith,I mean… the main character of the story.,
5423,,Wraith,She must have felt so lonely when she went into slumber.,"Yes, most likely."
5424,,Wraith,"…Luckily, I've still got Senpai here.",
5425,,Wraith,If I don't find Senpai after I wake up…,
5426,,Wraith,…be prepared to be frightened and fall at anytime from this day forth!,"Don't worry, I'll be here for sure."
5427,,Wraith,I trust Senpai… then… Goodnight.,Goodnight.
5428,,,"And with that, Wraith took a bite of the apple, and her eyes slowly shut while laying inside the coffin, entering into a deep slumber.",
5429,,,"Suddenly, a wave of drowsiness rushed over me indicating that I had deduced the story correctly after all.",
5430,,,A white light gradually intensified as the scene began to dissolve and slowly Wraith's figure blurred into white light.,
5431,,,"As my consciousness faded, the peaceful smile on Wraith's face became the last thing I saw.",
5432,,,As for this familiar castle and the bat carving on the coffin… reminded me of someone else.,
5433,Journey Beyond,,"As always, Valeera spends her day in her library, looking for the next book to read.",
5434,,Valeera,Huh? Does this book really belong in my library? I don't think I'd purchase a book with such a weird cover…,
5435,,Valeera,Oh no… Some of its pages are missing…,
5436,,Valeera,"But… according to the text, this should be a storybook… I'd better record the remaining pages before they get worn out.",
5437,,Valeera,Let's start with the pages that look worst.,
5438,,Valeera,"""Once upon a time, there was a boy who lived with his mother and their cow.""",
5439,,Valeera,"""One day, food ran out and the family had no other choice but to sell their one and only cow.""",
5440,,Valeera,"""The boy traded his cow to an old man for a few magic beans.""",
5441,,Valeera,About time a wizard showed up.,
5442,,Valeera,But what role does he play in this story?,
5443,,Valeera,"""Naturally, the mother was infuriated by what the boy had done and casted the beans out the window of their house.""",
5444,,Valeera,"""When the following day arrived, the boy woke up to find that the beans had sprouted into an enormous giant beanstalk reaching up into the clouds…""",
5445,,Valeera,A beanstalk that reaches up into the clouds? Sounds like a type of magic that I don't know about… Let's see what will happen next…,
5446,Declaration of Love,Turin,"Hottie! I received an anonymous letter, I don't know how to do with it.",
5447,,Hottie,An anonymous letter? Let me see... Uh... I think it's actually a love letter.,
5448,,Turin,Love letter? What's that?,
5449,,Hottie,It's the kind of letter used to profess one's love. It's about time this year for them to do this.,
5450,,Turin,What time?,
5451,,Hottie,Around 17th of September every year.,
5452,,Hottie,The rumors about the 17th of September is the best time in a year for one to do this are widely spread on campus.,
5453,,Hottie,Said the 100th day anniversary will be Christmas if you successfully profess someone on 17th of September…,
5454,,Turin,But… Doesn't that sound weird? If you just judge the best day to profess according to the time of its 100th day anniversary…,
5455,,Turin,The 24th of September should be a better choice. The 100th day anniversary will be on New Year's Day that way.,
5456,,Hottie,You got a point…,
5457,,Turin,And I cannot understand why they ignore Valentine's Day itself. What if we make the 100th Anniversary on the 14th of February...,
5458,,Hottie,That's…correct…,
5459,,Turin,Is there any further reason for this? I must have missed something.,
5460,,Hottie,Let's just forget about that. What are you going to do with this letter anyway?,
5461,,Turin,I don't know. I've asked my whole class for suggestion but received no answer. I even read it out aloud!,
5462,,Hottie,What? You read the letter aloud in public?,
5463,,Turin,I'm afraid the one who writes this is from other classes… Maybe I should try broadcast the letter to find her!,
5464,,Hottie,No…Wait! That's not a good idea!,
5465,Sports Meeting Guide,,It's a crisp autumn morning and I'm strolling towards the library.,
5466,,,"I was going to invite Iron Fist to hang out, but after knocking on her dorm room for ages, I decided to give up.",
5467,,,"I guess passing time at the library would be good too, if I happen to see Valeera, I can tell her all about the book I read yesterday.",
5468,,Librarian,"And I was wondering who the laid-back figure was strolling on campus, after taking a closer look, it was you after all, Senpai!",
5469,,*,"Librarian? What a coincidence. But from the way you said it, sounds like you have a misconception that I'm always free.",
5470,,*,"I'm actually on my way to read books at the library! I just finished an interesting book yesterday, wanna hear about it?",
5471,,Librarian,"Sorry, Senpai, I'd love to read books too, but I can't today.",
5472,,*,Oh? You actually have something more important to do than read a book?,
5473,,Librarian,"As for this question... I would be asking you the same, Senpai. Don't you have plans today?",
5474,,*,"Plans? I was going to ask Iron Fist to hang out, but she's not in her dorm room... I didn't see many people on my way here either...",
5475,,*,Or wait... Is there a big event that's happening on campus that everyone's gone to?,
5476,,Librarian,"What? Senpai, you really don't know? Today's the opening of the Sports Meeting!",
5477,,*,"(Sports Meeting? Now that I think about it, I think it IS that time of the year again...)",
5478,,*,"I'm surprised, I didn't think you'd attend events like the Sports Meeting~",
5479,,*,"Well, I barely attend so I've forgotten all about it, sorry, haha.",
5480,,Librarian,"Barely attend? Oh, that's right, since you're not in any of the Houses...",
5481,,Valeera,"Librarian, why are you still here? Everyone's been waiting for you, didn't you say that you were going to help me after you were done with that book?",
5482,,Valeera,"Senpai, you're here too? If you're not going to attend the Sports Meeting, don't hinder Librarian from going, she's got an important task to do~",
5483,,Librarian,"Valeera, the important task you're referring to wouldn't be taking care of the awards box that you mentioned before, would it...?",
5484,,*,"This outfit... Are you the referee, Valeera?",
5485,,*,"A part from Librarian, I'm surprised you're also this energetic about the Sports Meeting, Valeera~",
5486,,Valeera,The Sports Meeting is the biggest inter-house competition there is and the winning house will receive a special award from the academy!,
5487,,Valeera,"Although you might think the prize is not important, but the contestants are all hoping that their house wins~",
5488,,*,"Wow, Valeera, you're sure excited about it, makes me eager to want to try too!",
5489,,*,But why did you end up being a referee instead of competing?,
5490,,Librarian,"Better not get too deep into this question, Senpai...",
5491,,Librarian,"I think it's fine, but Valeera seems to bothered by it...",
5492,,Valeera,"Hmph, it's because everyone knows I'm not good at sports, so they all think I'm the best person to be the referee......",
5493,,Librarian,"So yea, and that's why I won't have time to read books with you today, Senpai~",
5494,,Librarian,"Don't be down, Valeera, a referee is also an important role~",
5495,,Valeera,"You're right! I'll do my best! Senpai, there's not further time to delay, we'll see you at the library after the Sports Meeting is over~",
5496,,,"As they were in a hurry, Valeera walked and talked with Librarian as they headed towards the sports field...",
5497,,*,"I get it. So if I just temporarily join a house then I can participiate too, right?",
5498,,Valeera,Temporarily join?,
5499,,Librarian,"Senpai, you mean, you want to participate in the Sports Meeting too?",
5500,,*,That's right! Just thinking about sweating on the competition field with the girls have got me excited! I'm not concerned about the prize.,
5501,,Valeera,"Senpai, you seem quite motivated! Then why not join Ghost house! Our house is short of a strong competitor such as myself, if it's you, Senpai, you're almost good enough to substitute me.",
5502,,Librarian,"Valeera, your eagerness to pull Senpai in could be counted as cheating!",
5503,,Librarian,"Senpai wouldn't just randomly join a house either, otherwise Iron Fist and the other students might not be happy about it~",
5504,,*,Uh... yea... Librarian is right! (Guess it could cause a problem...),
5505,,Valeera,"Well, since Librarian has spoken, then we'll find a fair method for you to join a house --",
5506,,*,What fair method?,
5507,,Valeera,"By answering questions! There were also students who didn't belong to any houses previously, so I specifically prepared a set of questions for this!",The questions will decide which house I'll join?|What type of questions will it be?
5508,,,"The fox-eared girl in front of me was wearing a referee's uniform with no pockets, but out of nowhere she took out a question sheet and handed it to me. ......",
5509,,Valeera,"All right, Senpai, just complete the questions and once it's done, my magic will reveal your house and it will be officially recorded  on the register~",
5510,,Valeera,"Librarian and I still have a few important things to prepare before the opening, we'll see you on the sports field later~",
5511,,Librarian,"Senpai, see you on the field later~",
5512,,*,"Hey, but...",
5513,,*,"Nevermind, it's fine. I'll just go with the referee's orders.","If anyone suspects, then I'll have a good explanation...|Which house will I be in...?|Hehe, I'm sure I'll win a lot of medals."
5514,,,Question one:,
5515,,,"In Iron Fist's dorm room, you find a hidden journal at her bedside, what is it --","""Secret! The Other Side of Senpai?""|""The Good Wife. Cooking is the Key""|""Girls Talk""|""Yume Dungeon Event Project"""
5516,,,Question two:,
5517,,,"During the 100m race, a student stumbles over. You're in the audience shouting --","""Keep going, there's still a chance!""|""Medics, quick!""|""Oh, it's that idiot again...""|""Don't stop!"""
5518,,,Question three:,
5519,,,"You're about to compete,  two students are willing to guide you hand in hand and carry out physical training. Who do you wish them to be --",Psychic and Mio|Fenrir and Kratos|Saint and Nobunaga|Iron Fist and Aquaris
5520,,,Question four:,
5521,,,You've accidentally given your best and broke the record on one of the competitions. What would this competition be --,Ball Games|Racing|Sumo Wrestling|Whac-A-Mole
5522,,,"The questions have all been answered, and as I put down my pen, the questionnaire suddenly disappeared.",
5523,,*,"Valeera has probably received the results, better head to the field to find out --",
5524,,Iron Fist,What is it? It's beautiful!,
5525,,Phoenix,"Oh, Iron Fist are you interested in sky lanterns too?",
5526,,Iron Fist,Sky lanterns? Is it like a handmade product?,
5527,,Phoenix,"Mmm... well, it's like a light that you light up on special occasions!",
5528,,Iron Fist,Special occasions...,
5529,,Wraith,I... know...,
5530,,Wraith,It is said that... it is a folk ritual... to express love for ghosts...,
5531,,Iron Fist,Eek! (Scared),
5532,,Wraith,Wow... It's beautiful... and just like that love has drifted away with the river...,
5533,,Phoenix,I think you meant a water lantern. I'm currently holding a sky lantern! Don't just throw the lantern into the river without permission! Where did you even appear from?,
5534,,Iron Fist,"Oh, I see!",
5535,,Phoenix,And what do you mean by love for spirits! It's to mourn the deceased and bless the living!,
5536,,Iron Fist,"Re...relax, Phoenix. Why are we discussing water lanterns anyway?",
5537,,Phoenix,Ahem... It's called a Sky Lantern. It's for the Lantern Festival!,
5538,,Wraith,Ah... releasing lanterns into water... for Lantern Festival...,
5539,,Phoenix,"No, no, that's for Ghost Festival. Do you have an obsession with water lanterns?",
5540,,Iron Fist,"Lanterns for Lantern Festival, seems wonderful.",
5541,,Wraith,Such warm light...,
5542,,Phoenix,Even the ghost feels warmth? Then the lanterns at the Lantern Festival must truly bring happiness!,
5543,,Wraith,Release the lanterns... into the river...,
5544,,Iron Fist,"You can't release the sky lanterns into the river, Wraith...",
5545,Puppet Parade,KongMing,Aquaris... Why are you dressed like this?,
5546,,Aquaris,It is said to be a relaxing costume for the body and mind.,
5547,,Aquaris,Apate vouched for that!,
5548,,KongMing,(Never thought someone could be dumb enough to be tricked by this kind of joke...),
5549,,Aquaris,At least now I feel great!,
5550,,Aquaris,Talking in ventriloquism is completely relaxing! You can say things that you can't say normally without any problem!,
5551,,Aquaris,"Maybe, it's in my nature!",
5552,,Apate,Or perhaps you have awakened your second personality hidden deep down~,
5553,,KongMing,"(... Apate must have found a way to manipulate her mind, Aquaris wouldn't do anything like this.)",
5554,,Aquaris,Using ventriloquism to express feelings... That's crafty...,
5555,,Aquaris,The words I don't usually dare to say are...,
5556,,Aquaris,Kong Ming! You don't have to always be so serious!,
5557,,Aquaris,Being so serious makes you look like an old lady!,
5558,,KongMing,??????,
5559,,Apate,"Well, I'd say it's solid evidence of her second personality awakening.",
5560,,Aquaris,This puppet seems to be filled with a soul full of love and hope...! It gives me the courage to do everything!,
5561,,KongMing,...,
5562,,Aquaris,"Okay, I'm heading out now!",
5563,,Aquaris,I shall liberate my nature some more!,
5564,,Apate,Oh... She's gone already... I didn't even get the chance to tell her this is just a joke for April Fool's Day.,
5565,,Apate,And there was no sense of accomplishment at all after making a successful joke on a fool like that...,
5566,,KongMing,"(All right, Aquaris is dumber than I thought...)",
5567,,Rogue,Place your bet here!,
5568,,*,What are you doing?,
5569,,Rogue,"We're having a bet, that's pretty obvious.",
5570,,,……,
5571,,,She looks very excited.,
5572,,,But what's she betting on?,
5573,,Raphael,I just hope nobody gets hurt from this.,
5574,,Rogue,"Senpai, do you want to place a bet to see who's gonna get her leg broken first in the tournament!",
5575,,,……,
5576,,,She totally ignored what Raphael said.,
5577,,KongMing,"Nobody's gonna get hurt, so there's no point in starting such a bet.",
5578,,*,A tournament that can guarantee no harm?,
5579,,KongMing,"You know, it's getting hot these days. So we need to distract THOSE who have too much energy to spare.",
5580,,,"Judging from what KongMing's looking at, Fenrir chasing Roselle right over there should be what she is referring to.",
5581,,KongMing,"Since the campus rules are not allowed to be broken, perhaps holding an official tournament can settle all this properly.",
5582,,*,In a safer and more peaceful way.,
5583,,,But someone's missing.,
5584,,*,Where's Frexie? I think she's supposed to help us out here.,
5585,,KongMing,She lost to Estel in a bet. So Estel asked her to run around the campus.,
5586,,Frexie,I WILL TASTE MY VICTORY NEXT TIMEEEEE!!!!,
5587,,*,I can totally imagine how embarassed she looks right now.,
5588,,,But having one less airhead here might have its perks.,
5589,,Rogue,Come on and place your bet! I bet Luna's going to lose the next battle---,
5590,,,Is there even an end to this?,
5591,,Rogue,Wut---,
5592,,,An arrow flies towards Rogue as she speaks.,
5593,,Rogue,Who's that? Don't you know this is very dangerous?,
5594,,Angelica,"The name is Angelica, I just enrolled at Yume Academy.",
5595,,Rogue,Never heard of the name.,
5596,,KongMing,"Great! Angelica, please help me end this chaos---",
5597,,Angelica,(Ignores KongMing) Why do you think Luna will lose the battle?,
5598,,Rogue,"Because her opponent, Caitlyn is stronger. That's a fact you cannot change.",
5599,,Angelica,I disagree.,
5600,,Angelica,"But if you insist, I think I can change your mind after you finish a battle against me and come back a loser.",
5601,,Rogue,Why do you think I would accept your challenge? And don't you even feel embarassed at all when you say something like that?,
5602,,Angelica,I'll bet with all the money I have.,
5603,,Rogue,"Okay, challenge accepted!",
5604,,KongMing,Senpai... please take my place and put things in order. I don't want to watch this anymore...,
5605,,,"KongMing, I don't think there'll be any good if you give up so soon....",
5606,,Rogue,"Senpai! I'm having a battle with this new Girl, please look after my gambling pit!",
5607,,*,How can I do two jobs at the same time...,
5608,,,Hopefully Raphael won't be mad after this is all over.,
5609,The Ones I Like,,The students in Yume Academy are setting up a performance to welcome the new girls.,
5610,,,"However, preparations for the stage showed no sign of being ready.",
5611,,,"Aquaris, who was assigned to stage settings, was anguished.",
5612,,Aquaris,I need more time to perfect this...! If only I could control time...,
5613,,*,I don't think this will help with your dilemma.,
5614,,Aquaris,It will! I heard Monica can do that. Can you please ask her to help me?,
5615,,,"Erm, but Monica only helps the few that she acknowledges...",
5616,,Aquaris,Senpai! Please? Pretty please?,
5617,,Aquaris,I really need your help with this...,
5618,,*,"I understand that it's an emergency, but don't be so pushy.",
5619,,Aquaris,"Look, Monica's right over there! Let's go!",
5620,,*,"...Hi, Monica. How are you today? Have you settled down in the Academy yet?",
5621,,Monica,"...I-I'm fine, thank you...",
5622,,Aquaris,Monica! Just the person I wanted to meet!,
5623,,Monica,...What's the matter?,
5624,,Aquaris,"I'll make it short. The Welcome Performance is coming up, but preparations are not done yet.",
5625,,Aquaris,So...,
5626,,*,"So, Aquaris here wants to ask whether you can help her slow time down, so she will have enough time to finish the preparations.",
5627,,Aquaris,"That's right! Monica, you can do that, right?",
5628,,Monica,"I can, but I don't think I should waste my time and effort on something as inane as this.",
5629,,Aquaris,I-Inane...?,
5630,,Monica,"...As you said, it is something that you are supposed to do. I don't like those that escape from their responsibilities...",
5631,,Aquaris,And here comes the lecture...,
5632,,Monica,"I'm not lecturing anybody. I'm just explaining the reason I'm not willing to help. As I said, I can slow the flow of time, but I would be helping you to shirk your duty by doing so.",
5633,,Aquaris,I just need more time for stage preparations...,
5634,,,"Monica shook her head, and Aquaris left the Cafeteria dejectedly.",
5635,,*,That's typical of Aquaris. Don't take it to heart.,
5636,,Monica,I don't see why I should. She's not worth my attention.,
5637,,*,"If you don't mind me asking, who is?",
5638,,Monica,...The smart and the wise...,
5639,,*,Such as?,
5640,,Monica,"I've traveled around the world, and met many that were wise...",
5641,,*,Sounds nice. I'd love to hear more about your travels.,
5642,,Monica,...I don't want to waste my time on the simple-minded.,
5643,,Monica,"If they would allow my presence, I would follow the wise, and learn more about them. Their minds, their thoughts...their pasts.",
5644,,*,But wouldn't that be too heavy for you?,
5645,,Monica,I don't know...,
5646,,Monica,But that kind of lifestyle seems interesting to me.,
5647,,*,"Hmm, then I think you'd like Dracula.",
5648,,Monica,Dracula?,
5649,,*,She fits all your descriptions.,
5650,,Monica,...Oh.,
5651,,*,"If Dracula asks you for help, would you agree to help her?",
5652,,Monica,...Would someone like her even need help from me?,
5653,,*,So will you help Dracula?,
5654,,Monica,If she needs my help...of course.,
5655,,*,Just as I thought.,
5656,,Monica,...Someone like that wouldn't ask for help on mundane affairs...,
5657,,*,"That's hard to say...Hmmm, what should I have for lunch today?",
5658,,*,What would you like?,
5659,,Monica,"I was on my way of leaving, in fact.",
5660,,*,...You didn't have to be so cold and aloof...even Aquaris was scared away. You can at least keep me company...,
5661,,Monica,...I didn't mean to be like that.,
5662,,*,"Nah, just joking. Don't worry about me, I can handle taking a meal alone.",
5663,,Monica,"Alright. Farewell, Senpai.",
5664,,,I can't imagine what's going on in Monica's mind. Her being silent most of the time doesn't help much either.,
5665,,,"As I watched her leave, I can't help but wonder what type of people she'd like.",

5672,,Monica,I'm just bored.,
5673,,*,"Understandable. Compared to what you have seen in your travels, Yume Academy must be terribly dull for you.",
5674,,Monica,That's...not what I meant.,
5675,,*,It's hard not to believe so when nothing on Campus seem to pique your interest.,
5676,,Monica,I don't like the crowd. The cafeteria is crowded.,
5677,,Monica,...I think I saw someone I knew from my travels in Yume Academy.,
5678,,*,Really? Who is it? I never heard you mention them before...,
5679,,Monica,I am surprised too.,
5680,,*,Do you know her name?,
5681,,Monica,I'm not sure...but she looks like the same as I remembered.,
5682,,*,What was she like back then?,

5685,,Monica,"Yes. She was a young girl, wandering in the shadows...",
5686,,*,...Yikes.,
5687,,*,Was she an orphan?,
5688,,Monica,Maybe...but she was more than that.,
5689,,Monica,"The town was small, and I would see her whenever I head out.",
5690,,Monica,I saw her bite onto the neck of another child.,
5691,,*,But why...?,
5692,,*,"Was she a vampire like Dracula, who must drink blood to survive?",
5693,,Monica,Vampires are strong...but she seemed...helpless.,
5694,,*,I see. Is that why you remembered her?,
5695,,Monica,"No...she was being bullied by others in the town, but I wasn't able to help her.",
5696,,*,Why? She could have hurt the other child for good.,
5697,,,Monica shook her head to my words.,
5698,,,"There was a hint of exasperation in her expression, as if there was something crucial that I didn't understand.",
5699,,Monica,...What if this was the only way to keep her alive? If there was another way...maybe she wouldn't have to hurt others.,
5700,,*,Way of survival? I thought only Vampires required blood from others. What happened next?,
5701,,Monica,"She was abused and rejected by the townsfolk, and I regret that I wasn't able to help.",
5702,,*,This isn't your fault.,
5703,,Monica,"I could have stopped them, but I didn't.",
5704,,*,"Everyone changes. If you saw her now, you would surely be able to help her. Besides, you're repenting now. That must mean something.",
5705,,Monica,It's too late. She died before my eyes...it's been years now. I don't think I will be able to find her grave...if she even has one.,
5706,,Monica,"If my powers allow me, I would have turned back time for her.",
5707,,Monica,...But not everything goes according to my wishes.,
5708,,,I saw tears in her eyes.,
5709,,Monica,"I had the power to help her, but I didn't do anything. I played a part in her death too...",
5710,,,"Monica seemed depressed...she blames herself for the death of the girl. It didn't show on her expression, but in the tone of her voice.",
5711,,Monica,If I could meet her again...I'd like to learn more about her. Even if this wouldn't change her death...,
5712,,*,You're very kind. I'm glad to learn about this side of you.,
5713,,*,Who reminds you of her here in Yume Academy? Dracula?,
5714,,,She shook her head again. It seems like her thoughts are a mess.,
5715,,,"I studied her expression, but drawn a blank.",
5716,,*,No? Then who could it be?,
5717,,,"I feigned thinking, but I don't want to keep guessing. This seems like a sensitive topic.",
5718,,*,"I can't think of anybody! Anyways, what's happened has happened.",
5719,,*,The future is more important; nothing changes if you keep blaming yourself for what happens.,
5720,,Monica,"...Thank you, Senpai.",
5721,,*,"It's nothing. I've been told that I'm a very good listener, and the girls do dump their emotional garbage on me from time to time. I'm very used to this.",
5722,,,She looked at me intently.,
5723,,Monica,Thank you. I think I might learn something significant here after all.,
5724,,*,"Well, take your time then!",
5725,Reversing the Time...On Stage,,The Welcoming Performance starts tonight.,
5726,,,Every performer can't wait to go on stage.,
5727,,,"Meanwhile, Apate is still rehearsing, and asking for my opinion.",
5728,,*,This sounds like something you put together an hour ago.,
5729,,Apate,Is it really that bad?,
5730,,*,"Nah, don't worry. As long as you put your heart to it, you should be alright.",
5731,,,"The performance has officially started. After the songs from the band and some dance performances, even Raphael sang a song.",
5732,,,"Everyone screams in excitement when Raphael appeared on stage. However, Monica is silent as usual.",
5733,,*,"Monica, was the performances tonight not to your liking?",
5734,,Monica,Of course not...I like Raphael's voice...,
5735,,*,That's not what your expression says~,
5736,,Monica,...I'm serious.,
5737,,*,"Just joking. Hmm, the clock is ticking down faster. Is this because you're happy?",
5738,,Monica,If only I could hear her sing everyday...,
5739,,*,"Sadly, Raphael rarely sings.",
5740,,,A loud crash interrupted our conversation.,
5741,,,"When we turn towards the stage, we see a huge stage light crash right in the middle of the stage.",
5742,,*,...Oh my...what was Aquaris doing? She was in charge of stage preparations!,
5743,,*,Is anyone hurt?,
5744,,,"Monica and I rush to the stage, where a hurt Raphael lay.",
5745,,,It seems like the doctor needs another doctor now...,
5746,,Monica,Raphael! Are you alright?,
5747,,,"Monica, who never showed intense emotions, looks worried.",
5748,,Aquaris,"I-I'm sorry, Raphael, I must have missed this when I was checking the preparations for the last time...",
5749,,Raphael,Don't worry...it's just...my head...,
5750,,,She faints before finishing her sentence.,
5751,,,"Raphael was the one everyone turned to for medical treatment. Now that Raphael needs medical treatment herself, nobody knows who to turn to.",
5752,,Apate,What should we do now?,
5753,,*,Let's bring her to the Infirmary first.,
5754,,,"Monica glares at Aquaris, who looks away in embarrassment.",
5755,,,But she said nothing.,
5756,,Aquaris,"I am so, so sorry...I will take responsibility for this accident.",
5757,,Monica,...You.,
5758,,,"All of a sudden, the Hall starts to spin.",
5759,,,"It's like being caught in a tornado, and I'm blown away...",
5760,,,...right back to my seat. Am I dreaming?,
5761,,,...What just happened?,
5762,,*,"Oooh, Raphael's singing today. You don't see this every day.",
5763,,*,"Monica, look, this is Raphael...wait, where's Monica?",
5764,,,The girl that sat beside me is now on the stage. I didn't know she could teleport.,
5765,,,"Just as I was pondering about this, the stage lights fall towards Raphael, and Monica pushes her away just in time.",
5766,,,As if she knew that the stage light will fall...,
5767,,,Crash-----,
5768,,Apate,Raphael! Are you alright?,
5769,,Raphael,"I-I'm fine. If it wasn't for Monica, I would have been seriously injured. Thank you.",
5770,,Monica,As long as you're okay.,
5771,,Aquaris,"I-I'm sorry, Raphael, I must have missed this when I was checking the preparations for the last time...",
5772,,Aquaris,"I'm so glad that you're okay! If you were hurt, I might be murdered by everyone in Yume Academy.",
5773,,*,Aquaris!,
5774,,,I flick her forehead lightly.,
5775,,*,You should be thankful that no one was hurt this time. If this happens again...,
5776,,Aquaris,"I know, I know. I will be more careful from now on! I'm really sorry!",
5777,,,"While no one was hurt, the stage is ruined.",
5778,,,Monica shrugs.,
5779,,*,Did you know the stage light would fall?,
5780,,Monica,"...I saw it wobble, and was worried that it might fall. I came to check.",
5781,,*,That's so attentive of you. Unlike someone else...,
5782,,*,"And the performance ended prematurely. I'm blaming you, Aquaris!",
5783,,,I told her off jokingly.,
5784,,,"Apate runs after Aquaris as well, screaming all the way.",
5785,,Apate,"Aquaris, don't you even think of running! I'll make you see the errors of your ways!",
5786,,Aquaris,Please don't! This will not happen again-------,
5787,Miss Yume,,"Nephilim has been voted as Miss Yume in the contest. However, it seems like not everyone agrees upon this…",
5788,,Student A,"Of everyone that could have had this honor, why Nephilim? For starters, we don't even know where did she come from!",
5789,,Student B,"Yeah! Besides, she is always muttering to herself. It's sort of creepy if you ask me.",
5790,,Nephilim,"…They really don't intend on keeping quiet, don't they? Well, I can make sure they shut up…",
5791,,Nephilim,Please don't. This is not the time for you to lose your temper.,
5792,,Student A,"There she goes again…she can't stay normal even for a second, can she?",
5793,,Nephilim,"You might want to reconsider your actions. Someone IS trying to speak on stage, after all. Besides, I have ears.",
5794,,,Nephilim's expression hardens. The next thing the students know is that Nephilim is in front of them instead of being on the stage.,
5795,,,The fight is…unexpected for all.,
5796,,KongMing,"Behave, the all of you. There are no enemies in Yume Academy now, so no fighting is allowed.",
5797,,Nephilim,My apologies. This will not happen again.,
5798,,KongMing,"Lucifer's temper is short as ever. Michael, is there anything you can do about this?",
5799,,Nephilim,…The relationship between Michael and me is none of your business…,
5800,,Nephilim,"Shush!... I'm sorry, I'll see what I can do.",
5801,,Nephilim,"Whatever, they're not worth my attention. If you don't want me to keep arguing with them, I won't.",
5802,,Nephilim,I hope the Ritual never happened. I could have been gaming in my dorm instead of wasting time here…,
5803,,,The Ritual was one of the most significant changes in the lives of Michael and Lucifer.,
5804,,,"Due to the Ritual, they lost their memories and fused together to form the Nephilim that we know today.",
5805,,*,"Speaking of the Ritual, do you still remember what happened on that day?",
5806,,Nephilim,I do. We heard a stranger speaking in front of the church that day. She introduced herself as Kratos.,…So Kratos did cause all of this.
5807,,Nephilim,We had no idea who she was. Her arrogance was very irritating though.,
5808,,Nephilim,"Anyways, she was rambling on and on about the Girls and Li, and we were agitated upon hearing her words…and you know the rest.",
5809,,*,How did you feel after the Ritual?,
5810,,Nephilim,"…After waking up, we didn't know who we were…but we felt something pulling us together.",
5811,,Nephilim,"We tried to ignore this feeling, but it just grew stronger, especially when I meet Lucifer. This continued until the day of the Ritual when I heard what Kratos said.",
5812,,Nephilim,"The feeling overwhelmed me, and I lost consciousness in the blinding light.",
5813,,Nephilim,"When I woke up, I became Nephilim with Michael. I hate to admit it, but Michael is correct.","You're pulled together by Fate, I'd say.|You two do share a very intriguing relationship."
5814,,Nephilim,"Did the ""Li"" that Kratos mentioned plan this as well? It's just…awkward without your own body.","How so?|I mean, both of you are girls. This can't be too awkward."
5815,,Nephilim,Imagine being peeked upon when you take a bath or when you go to sleep.,
5816,,Nephilim,"I did nothing of the sort. Stop spouting nonsense, Lucifer!",
5817,Balancing out,,I walked Nephilim to her dorm after the Ceremony ended.,
5818,,*,"Now that I think about it, you seem blessed.",
5819,,Nephilim,"Blessed? I, the mighty fallen Angel, always believe I am cursed. Besides, which part of this situation is a blessing for me?","You know, being united with your missing half and all that.|Curses may sometimes be a blessing in disguise."
5820,,*,"Look, Michael is rule-abiding, but lacks the drive to push through.",
5821,,*,Lucifer is determined but pays no heed to trouble.,
5822,,*,You balance each other out perfectly!,
5823,,Nephilim,"…Senpai, did you hit your head somewhere?",
5824,,,Nephilim's words and her expression don't match.,
5825,,,"It seems like Michael, who is in control of their body, doesn't agree with Lucifer.",
5826,,*,"I mean, the Gods and Fate are bringing you together. What happened to cause this must have some meaning.",
5827,,Nephilim,"…Why do I feel like I'm paying back some debt I owed you in a past life, Lucifer?",
5828,,Nephilim,"…Interesting, I feel the same.",
5829,,,"All of a sudden, a fierce beast appears.",
5830,,,Its claws and teeth are sharp as a lion's.,
5831,,,Malevolent purple flames burn in its eyes.,
5832,,,It looks like another creature corrupted by Chaos.,
5833,,*,"Nephilim, stay back, I got this.",
5834,,Nephilim,"Senpai, don't worry, we can fight too. If anything, you should be the one staying behind us.",
5835,True Champion(s),,Nephilim finishes off the corrupted beast in a matter of seconds.,
5836,,,"Her movements are graceful, as if the beast posed no threat to her.",
5837,,,Michael and Lucifer never showed such skill before the Ritual.,
5838,,,I was entranced by her movements.,
5839,,Nephilim,"Senpai, are you alright?",
5840,,Nephilim,Look at how stupid he looks.,
5841,,*,"I-it's nothing, I'm just marveling how you seem to be so at ease with this compared with before.",
5842,,*,Your style seems different too.,
5843,,Nephilim,"Stronger than before? Ha, then being stuck with Angel Girl here has its merits too.",
5844,,Nephilim,"…Besides, we are Nephilim now.",
5845,,,"Nephilim smiles and her eyes form crescent moons, as if she truly is at ease with the other soul in her body.",
5846,,Nephilim,If being Nephilim enables us to find out the truth about this world…,
5847,,Nephilim,And the meaning of our existence…,
5848,,Nephilim,Then we don't mind staying together for longer.,
5849,,,Nephilim smiles again. The modesty shown in the eyes of Michael has the confidence of Lucifer mixed in them.,
5850,,,I am captivated by the light that shone in them.,
5851,,Nephilim,Senpai? Hello? Anybody home?,
5852,,Nephilim,In a trance again? Don't tell me you fell in love with me now.,
5853,,Nephilim,"If you really did, then you might want to make sure which one it is that you fell for.",
5854,,,I don't know what to say.,
5855,,Nephilim,You can only be with one person at a time. Or are you greedy and want both of us?,
5856,,Nephilim,Stop making fun of him.,
5857,,,"I can't make out who is the one speaking right now: Michael, or Lucifer?",
5858,,,All I can think is that…,
5859,,,"…if there is anyone fit to be chosen as Miss Yume, then it must be Nephilim.",
5860,Nephilim's Thoughts,,Nephilim winked at me.,
5861,,,I have the oddest feeling that she saw right through me.,
5862,,Nephilim,I am aware that there are those in Yume Academy that believe I am not fitting to be Miss Yume. They can have the name and the honor if they want to.,
5863,,Nephilim,"…As long as I live up to the name of ""Nephilim"", it will be enough for me.",
5864,,,"I realize with a start that they referred to themselves as ""I"" instead of ""us"".",
5865,,,"There is a peaceful smile on her face, and she seems to glow in the dark night.",
5866,,,The endless darkness of a fallen angel is surrounded by the gentle light.,
5867,,Nephilim,Maybe it is just as you said: I became Nephilim because the world needed me.,
5868,,,"A pause, then she continues.",
5869,,Nephilim,The truth of this world is like an unsolved puzzle.,
5870,,Nephilim,"But no matter what it is, I am ready to face it.",
5871,,Nephilim,I am prepared from the day that we accepted each other and became Nephilim.,
5872,,,Michael and Lucifer surely have come a long way from who they once were. The determination in Nephilim's words is unmistakable.,
5873,,,"The threads of their Fates intertwined, just like two trees that gradually grown into one.",
5874,,,"…Their roots will grow deeper together, and their branches will reach for the sky...",
