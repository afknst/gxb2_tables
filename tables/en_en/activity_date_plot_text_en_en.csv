101101,Photo Studio-1,*,"I never knew there was a photo studio here, maybe we can take a photo together~",
101102,,Giana,Take a photo...? I thought we had to hire a professional photographer and do that at home.,
101103,,*,"Maybe you've never heard of it, but this is the place where ordinary people take photos, just come with me~",
101104,,Giana,Oh... Is that so? Thanks for telling me…,
101105,,Giana,But why are you staring at me? Is there something on my face?,
101106,,Giana,Huh? So you were really staring at me?,
101107,,Giana,"Senpai, you're so cute~ Even when you're coming up with an excuse...",
101108,,Giana,This praise is still too much for me~,
101201,Photo Studio-2,Giana,"Oh, it's the photo studio from last time~",
101202,,*,"Yes, and the shopkeeper wasn't in last time, which was a pity. But I'm pretty sure we can successfully take a photo this time.",
101203,,Giana,"Well... I won't refuse such invitation, but Senpai, please don't stare at me like you did last time...",
101204,,*,"Oh... Okay, I'll try my best...",
101205,,Shopkeeper,"Welcome, are you here to take photos? If so, I suggest you change into the prepared clothes we have here~",
101206,,Shopkeeper,"As I predicted, you must be a couple! Those fit you very well!",
101207,,Giana,"Senpai, you look perfect~ But, let me tighten the neckline for you.",
101208,,Giana,"That's hurtful, you aren't even willing to change your outfit for me…",
101301,Photo Studio-3,*,The shopkeeper said we will be able to get our photo today~,
101302,,Giana,I thought we could get them instantly after taking the photo... Sorry to embarass you by saying this last time in the studio...,
101303,,*,"Don't worry, you just need more experience with normal life~",
101304,,*,"Also, I asked the shopkeeper to print an additional photo for you.",
101305,,Shopkeeper,"Sorry, due to a printer error, you will need to wait a little longer for the second photo.",
101306,,Giana,"Oh, can I really have this?! Thank you so much, I will cherish it…",
101307,,Shopkeeper,"Sorry, but looks like you won't be getting the second photo anytime soon...",
101308,,Giana,"What a pity, but the wait isn't too bad if Senpai is around.",
101309,,*,We can print the photo whenever we want with this.,
101310,,Giana,"I've got a better suggestion, saving my appearance inside your brain is always faster than printing with film~",
102101,Michaelin-starred-1,*,I've never been to a restaurant like this before... It might cost me a year's internship pay to even have a meal here...,
102102,,Giana,"Senpai, are you saying something?",
102103,,*,Oh... I was thinking which dish I should suggest to you.,
102104,,Giana,"That's a relief, I was worried you'd be upset because of the price of this place.",
102105,,Giana,"But since you've been here before, please order for me.",
102106,,*,"Oh no, what did I say?!",
102107,,Giana,"Nice pick~ The name comes from Mont Blanc, as the dish resembles a snow-capped mountain.",
102108,,Giana,I hope we can go skiing together this winter…,
102109,,Giana,I admit this is a surprise...,
102110,,*,W-What's wrong?,
102111,,Giana,"Nothing, I'm just surprised that you also know how tasty it really is. You know, most people won't choose this dish because of its appearance.",
102112,,Giana,"Wow... This is my favourite! You really know me well, Senpai.",
102201,Michaelin-starred-2,*,What have I done? I tasted the dish!!!!,
102202,,*,Looks like I can't ask for a refund anymore... Hope they can accept my dishwashing labour as payment...,
102203,,Giana,"Senpai, how does it taste?",
102204,,Giana,Cash... You mean paper money? Why would you eat that?,
102205,,Giana,"It's a pity, I hoped to give you a better memory...",
102206,,Giana,"Maybe you can try my dish, it's nice.",
102207,,Giana,Huh? Is that so?,
102208,,Giana,Looks like I don't even need to introduce you the hidden recipe here.,
102301,Michaelin-starred-3,Giana,"Thank you for the meal~ I'm really full now. Senpai, what about you?",
102302,,*,Me too...,
102303,,*,"I've never wished harder for time to stop, so I won't need to pay the bill.",
102304,,Giana,"Senpai, you don't need to pay, this restaurant belongs to my family~",
102305,,Giana,But you look so cool when you're trying to spend money for me!,
102306,,Giana,"Don't worry, this restaurant belongs to my family, it's free of charge~",
102307,,Giana,"But I never thought you would tell me the truth, do you think our relationship has gotten to that level already? I'm so happy~",
102308,,Giana,"(Stops me) Senpai, you don't need to pay, the restaurant belongs to my family~",
103101,Japanese Costume Store-1,Giana,"Oh, we've come this far?",
103102,,*,It's the Kimono flagship store. I guess you also customized your Furisode here? It suits you perfectly.,
103103,,Giana,"You got me, but I'm happy to know that you're paying attention to me~ (Covers her face because of embarassment)",
103104,,*,Did I say anything strange?,
103105,,Giana,"If you really like this, you can check me IN-AND-OUT~",
103106,,Giana,Huh? I thought you were really charming me... This is really disappointing.,
103107,,Giana,"That's just too... Senpai, you're really making my heart race...",
103108,,Giana,I hope you can join me when I customize my next kimono~,
103201,Japanese Costume Store-2,Giana,"And since we're already here, why don't we go in and take a look? I'm pretty sure you can find one that suits you.",
103202,,*,Huh? Me? But I don't have any experience in a luxury store like this one.,
103203,,Giana,"(Smiles) Senpai, are you nervous? Don't worry, I won't peep when you are trying suits on~",
103204,,Giana,It's a traditional pick~,
103205,,Giana,"But, Senpai, you know Haoris in this color are for weddings, right?",
103206,,Giana,"Senpai, it suits you really well~ And it makes us look more like a perfect couple!",
103207,,Giana,"Nah, this looks really old fashioned. I believe a lighter color would suit you better.",
103301,Japanese Costume Store-3,Saleswoman,"Oh Giana, you're here again for our products? What would you like today?",
103302,,Saleswoman,"Wait~ Looks like you bring a young man with you~ Tell me, are you actually...",
103303,,*,Huh? Actually what...,
103304,,Giana,"Don't make useless guesses. He's not my boyfriend, for now.",
103305,,*,"She's right, this is just an ordinary date.",
103306,,Giana,"Of course, we can't tell what will happen in the future~",
103307,,Giana,Are you trying to avoid our last topic? That's not nice.,
103308,,Giana,Then you need to keep up the good work~,
103309,,Saleswoman,Don't be too nervous. Let's check out the new brand of this season first.,
104101,Snack Store-1,Shop Keeper,"Greetings, how can I help you?",
104102,,Shop Keeper,"This is the best season for Yokan, please try it out~",
104103,,*,"She's so passionate, maybe customers will be scared away.",
104104,,Giana,"Not to everyone, it's just because I'm a regular customer.",
104105,,Giana,"This is a famous Japanese store, don't miss out~",
104106,,Shop Keeper,"Here, please pick which flavor you want.",
104107,,Giana,"I didn't see this flavor last time, must be new~ (Chewing) Nice! It tastes so sweet.",
104108,,Giana,"Good! It tastes fresh. This is a perfect dessert after dinner. Senpai, you're so thoughtful.",
104109,,Giana,Guess nothing can beat a classic? But I suggest trying something new next time!,
104201,Snack Store-2,Giana,I also suggest you also try the Warabimochi here~,
104202,,Shop Keeper,"This is the star product in our store, please try it out.",
104203,,*,I'll try it as long as you're the one who recommends it.,
104204,,Giana,That's the unique selling proposition of it! I'm glad you like it as much as I do.,
104205,,Giana,"This is why you cannot judge everything only by its appearance, you will need delve deeper~",
104206,,Giana,"What a pity, maybe I should recommend the snacks that are blander next time.",
104301,Snack Store-3,Shop Keeper,"After enjoying our snacks, you can take a rest in our garden behind the store~",
104302,,*,"Huh? I noticed a ""No Entry"" sign at the door...",
104303,,Giana,"Don't worry, I've talked with the shopkeeper beforehand so we're allowed to enter. There's something special there I want to show you.",
104304,,*,Something special... Why are you making it sound so strange?,
104305,,Giana,"There are Hydrangeas all over the garden~ You must've been expecting it, I can tell from your expression...",
104306,,Giana,"Ta-Da, here is the limited spring edition of Wagashi~",
104307,,Giana,"Accept this as a souvenir of this trip, I believe you will like it~",
104308,,Giana,"Huh? Your reaction is far less intense than I expected... But please believe me, drinking tea in a specially prepared garden is really romantic~",
105101,Talk in the Garden-1,*,Why don't we take a rest here. It must be hard for you to move around with the pair of high heels you're wearing.,
105102,,Giana,"Are you worried about me? Senpai, you're such a gentleman.",
105103,,*,"Gentleman, no, I don't think so, I'm just fulfilling the duty of a senior.",
105104,,Giana,"So, you mean you are this gentle to all the girls on campus?",
105105,,Giana,Awww... I was hoping you would pay additional attention to me.,
105106,,Giana,"Haha, don't take it too seriously, Senpai. I'm just kidding~",
105107,,Giana,"That's a sly answer, you must have read questions like this on the internet!",
105201,Talk in the Garden-2,Giana,I'm getting thirsty after this long walk~,
105202,,*,Didn't you bring any water with you?,
105203,,Giana,"Actually, any water bottle is too big for my pocket~",
105204,,Giana,And I won't deny I want to feel you care as well...,
105205,,Giana,"Have you put your mouth on this bottle before? If so, we're kissing indirectly~",
105206,,Giana,"I'm not feeling thirsty anymore. Please sit down and rest, Senpai.",
105207,,Giana,I don't want to see you running yourself ragged for me~,
105208,,Giana,"I know that store, it's highly recommended by other students. But I still want to rest some more here.",
105301,Talk in the Garden-3,Giana,"I was really looking forward this date. Senpai, did you feel the same last night?",
105302,,*,Well... So did I...,
105303,,Giana,Really? Can you prove it to me?,
105304,,Giana,You did this much research for me? That's really romantic.,
105305,,Giana,??? Is this for me?,
105306,,Giana,I'm so happy... I will cherish this with my life!,
105307,,Giana,"!!! Senpai! This is too much! Listen carefully, you're increasing my heart rate too quickly!",
106101,Goldfish Scooping-1,Giana,These fish look so beautiful~,
106102,,*,"Oh, they're goldfish, their scales look even prettier under the light of fireworks~",
106103,,*,Don't you want to try keep one for yourself?,
106104,,Giana,"But... I've never kept fish before, even if I get one from here...",
106105,,Giana,It sounds complicated. Can you teach me more details?,
106106,,Giana,I just hope I can overcome this with you~,
106107,,Giana,"Is this an invitation? Please don't worry, I will visit you regularly with or without the goldfish~",
106201,Goldfish Scooping-2,*,Which goldfish have you decided to scoop?,
106202,,Giana,"This is really tough choice, every single one of them looks beautiful and spirited...",
106203,,Giana,"Senpai, can you make the choice for me?",
106204,,*,Why me? I thought it will be better for you to make your own decision.,
106205,,Giana,"Because... The choice is really too hard, I cannot just pick one out of all of them.",
106206,,Giana,"It's shiny! I can already imagine how beautiful it will look under sunlight~ You are so thoughtful to pick this one for me, Senpai!",
106207,,Giana,"It has a pair of bright eyes! Just like yours, Senpai~",
106208,,Giana,"Senpai, watch closely, there's a lot of bubbles coming out of its mouth~",
106209,,Giana,Maybe it also has a lot of words to say to you~,
106301,Goldfish Scooping-3,*,I strongly suggest you try this yourself. Just pick the one you love most~,
106302,,Giana,But I'm really unexperienced in raising anything... What if I fail to keep them well?,
106303,,Giana,I don't feel so good as I think you care about a fish's loneliness more than mine...,
106304,,Giana,I just hope you can pay more attention to me instead of the goldfish.,
106305,,Stall owner,"Hey! If you keep saying things like that, I'll kick you out of my store!",
107101,Fried Noodles Booth-1,Giana,"Emmm? This smells nice, what is it?",
107102,,*,It's fried noodles! You can find a booth that sells fried noodles in every market. I can buy you one if you're interested.,
107103,,Giana,"I've never had this before... Senpai, do you also like this?",
107104,,Giana,"I see, so the saying, ""The key to a man's heart is through his stomach~"" must be true!",
107105,,Giana,That's really sly! How can I refuse you if you say so?,
107106,,Giana,That's a really irresponsible answer.,
107201,Fried Noodles Booth-2,*,"Giana, have you made a decision yet?",
107202,,Giana,Uh... Maybe the Soy Sauce flavor? Seafood flavor? The Mustard flavor also seems nice...,
107203,,Cook,Decide already! There are a lot of people waiting behind you!,
107204,,*,"Calm down, it's Giana's first time at somewhere like this, let her take her time.",
107205,,Cook,"But it's already been 10 minutes. It's far more than ""some time""!",
107206,,Giana,"Oh~ It's delicious! I knew I could count on you, Senpai~",
107207,,Giana,"Well, they even put some octopus slices in it. Senpai, if you want to try it, come closer and I will feed you~",
107208,,Giana,Wow...,
107209,,*,Are you alright? Is it too spicy for you?,
107210,,Giana,"No... It's delicious. I believe you will also love it, Senpai.",
107211,,,I start tearing up after tasting the noodles.,
107212,,*,"Water... I need water. Giana, if you want to become an actress, you have a promising future.",
107301,Fried Noodles Booth-3,,"After finishing the fried noodles, a strange girl shows up.",
107302,,Quinie,"Shopkeeper! I need 10 dishes of fried noodles, 5 dishes soy sauce and 5 dishes mustard!",
107303,,*,10... 10 dishes?! Can she really eat that much?,
107304,,Cook,Alright! Please wait a minute.,
107305,,,"The shopkeeper accepted the order without any hesitation, maybe Quinie has already ""impressed"" her before.",
107306,,,"But maybe she wants to complete all 10 dishes at once. Suddenly, a mistake is made.",
107307,,Giana,"Oh! Senpai, are you alright? Are you hurt or something? I can call my private doctor here if necessary~",
107308,,Giana,"That was close! I hope you're not injured, Senpai. But I believe you will need a new suit...",
107309,,Giana,I never thought your arms could be so warm.,
107310,,Giana,"Senpai, thank you very much. But I thought you would take the chance and get closer to me~",
108101,Mask Store-1,Giana,Senpai~ Is that a mask store over there? I believe the masks of the visitors in this night market come from there~,
108102,,*,"So, are you interested?",
108103,,Giana,Of course! Nobody will know my identity if I put one on my face! So they won't feel strange about my kimono either!,
108104,,Giana,"Senpai, that's really nice of you... But maybe too embarassing.",
108105,,Giana,Which part of me do you love the most then?,
108106,,Giana,"Senpai, but you should still understand that ""Women dress up for their beholders"".",
108201,Mask Store-2,Giana,"Thanks for your comfort, but I still want to buy a mask~",
108202,,*,So that you can reinvent yourself to the group of people?,
108203,,Giana,"No... I'm just thinking, we'll look more like a couple with masks on our faces.",
108204,,Giana,"Senpai, please come with me.",
108205,,Giana,"So~ You really want to be a couple with me? Senpai, there's still a long way to go.",
108206,,Giana,That's really disappointing to know you didn't even think about that.,
108207,,Giana,"I'm happy to know that you care this much for me, but it is okay.",
108301,Mask Store-3,Mask Seller,"Come closer, and tell me which mask you like the most~",
108302,,Giana,"Which one should I choose? Tengu? Fox? Oh, this Hyottoko mask also looks cute~",
108303,,Mask Seller,"Dear customer, I believe all of them would look great on your face~",
108304,,Giana,"Thanks for the compliment, but I will leave the right to choose to Senpai~",
108305,,Giana,"A fox mask? Combined with my tails and ears, I'm totally a fox with this mask!",
108306,,Giana,"There's no doubt you like foxes a lot, Senpai~",
108307,,Giana,"Oh, a Tengu mask? In legends, Tengu would kidnap the lost kid. And I hope you're the lost kid I can kidnap as a Tengu.",
108308,,Giana,I must look funny with this on my face...,
108309,,Giana,"Senpai, put one of them on! I don't want to be the only person others are gonna laugh at.",
109101,Fireworks Festival-1,*,"It's getting dark, I suggest we go to the site now so we can get a good spot to watch the fireworks~",
109102,,Giana,We can see the firework display here?,
109103,,*,That's right. This is the original reason this night market is held.,
109104,,Giana,"I'd love to see it, but... My shoes are stopping me from moving faster...",
109105,,,"I finally notice that Giana is slowing down, she must be very exhausted because of her heels.",
109106,,Giana,"Senpai, please don't worry. This will also slow you down.",
109107,,Giana,But.. It doesn't feel bad...,
109108,,Giana,"I've always looked forward to this, but now it's actually happening, I start to feel embarassed.",
109109,,Giana,But you will have no shoes to wear if you do so.,
109110,,Giana,"Okay... I understand, but please turn around when I'm changing.",
109201,Fireworks Festival-2,*,How do you feel?,
109202,,Giana,"Well... It still hurts, but I feel a lot better than before~",
109203,,*,I still think you need to visit a doctor.,
109204,,Giana,"Don't worry, otherwise this might make me miss the fireworks show.",
109205,,Giana,"Stop, I don't want to go to hospital. I might miss the firework shows because of it.",
109206,,Giana,The injury is acceptable if it is what it takes to have a wonderful experience with you.,
109207,,Giana,Will you think I'm too delicate? We haven't actually travelled that far.,
109208,,Giana,I hope you won't feel bad because of this.,
109209,,Giana,Are you leaving me here alone?,
109301,Fireworks Festival-3,Giana,I think I'm fully recovered after some rest~,
109302,,*,That's great! I should have noticed your injury earlier.,
109303,,Giana,"Senpai, don't blame yourself, it's not your fault!",
109304,,Giana,This is the best spot for watching fireworks!,
109305,,Giana,"Also the best spot to watch you, Senpai",
109306,,Giana,"Senpai, watch the surface of the lake! There's a clear reflection of the firework display",
109307,,Giana,It's beautiful like a dream.,
109308,,Giana,"It's still a new experience for me to watch in the crowd. But everything is nice as long as you are standing by my side, Senpai.",
110101,Beauty Pageant-1,Student A,Have you heard the news? A beauty pageant is being held here. Many girls will sign up with their best swimsuits.,
110102,,Student B,Really? That will be a beautiful scene to see~ Show me the way!,
110103,,Giana,"Beauty pageant... Swimsuit... Senpai, do you also wish to go?",
110104,,Giana,"Really? Senpai, no one likes a liar.",
110105,,Giana,"Senpai, you're really a bad liar.",
110106,,Giana,"Maybe, but I don't want to~ I'm not for display.",
110201,Beauty Pageant-2,*,"Giana, you look completely different once you heard about this competition~",
110202,,Giana,"Make no mistake, Senpai. I'm just here because I've never seen anything like this before.",
110203,,*,Are you trying to figure something out?,
110204,,Giana,"Senpai, why do you ask something like that?!",
110205,,Giana,"Senpai, don't try to avoid the topic.",
110206,,Giana,I'm already the most beautiful student on campus! With or without confirmation.,
110207,,Giana,"Even if you say so, I'm not leaving until this is over.",
110208,,Giana,All hidden threats should be removed soon as they are detected.,
110301,Beauty Pageant-3,*,This is it? I think it's really a waste of time...,
110302,,Giana,"Senpai, is that because you don't see anyone you like?",
110303,,*,Huh? I didn't mean that at all.,
110304,,Giana,"Even if you say so, I believe you've already got your own answer in mind.",
110305,,Giana,But I think No.5 candidate has the best body~,
110306,,*,Really?,
110307,,Giana,"Senpai, you're paying attention after all.",
110308,,Giana,Senpai... That's not the answer I want to hear.,
111101,Theater Hall-1,*,This should be the same theater you performed your dance before~,
111102,,Giana,"Yes, they used to have a routine performance each month, but it also provides dramas and operas.",
111103,,*,"I heard only the highest grade of performances are allowed to be played here. Guess that means you're really talented, Giana.",
111104,,Giana,"Senpai, have you seen me dance before?",
111105,,Giana,"You mean you have seen each one of them? That's definitely a lie, Senpai.",
111106,,Giana,Maybe you can tell me which one you liked the most later~,
111107,,Giana,I prepared a special costume just impress everyone.,
111108,,Giana,I'm glad to know you were there that day.,
111109,,Giana,That's really a pity~ I even prepared a special costume for my farewell performance.,
111110,,Giana,But I'm no longer a dancer now. Maybe I can dance just for you later.,
111201,Theater Hall-2,*,"But since we're already here, I think we should watch a performance. Is there anything you want to see?",
111202,,Giana,"Me? Well... Romeo and Juliet, Don Quixote, Swan Lake... That's a tough choice... Let's just watch them all~",
111203,,*,All? You mean all of them?,
111204,,Giana,"Just kidding~ Senpai, you can make the decision for me.",
111205,,Giana,That's a tragic love story. Two lovers died just because of a misunderstanding.,
111206,,*,Maybe the tragedy won't happen if they communicated earlier.,
111207,,Giana,You're right... Hopefully that won't happen to us.,
111208,,Giana,"This is my favourite comedy~ The entire story is filled with laughter. Senpai, you really know me so well.",
111209,,Giana,"Senpai, this is the last one I thought you would choose... But which swan do you prefer? The white one or the black one?",
111210,,Giana,"Shh! You don't really need to answer this one, I can be whichever swan you like~",
111301,Theater Hall-3,*,"Hello, 2 tickets please.",
111302,,Ticket Seller,"Sorry, but there are no proper tickets for couples, there are only separated seats now.",
111303,,Giana,"That's really bad news, I don't want to sit in a seat without Senpai by my side.",
111304,,Giana,"Senpai, you've paid so much effort just for my unreasonable wish... What should I do in return?",
111305,,*,"Sorry for making you wait this long, Giana.",
111306,,Giana,"Don't be sorry, I can wait as long as you are here.",
111307,,*,"Giana, I bought the ticket behind your seat, you can call me whenever you want.",
111308,,Giana,"Senpai, you should really go improve your EQ.",
112101,Auditorium-1,*,"Excuse us, please make way, our seats are up front.",
112102,,*,"Giana, are you alright? Sorry but we can only get the seats in the middle...",
112103,,Giana,"Senpai, you don't need to feel sorry all the time.",
112104,,Giana,You are much more gentle than a person should be.,
112105,,Student A,Hurry up. Are you passing here or not?,
112106,,Student B,And what is this troublesome costume all about? This is not a place for clowns.,
112107,,Student A,Still so gentle after your girlfriend was insulted? Coward.,
112108,,Giana,"Senpai, are you saying I'm attractive? I'm so happy to know that~",
112109,,Giana,"Senpai, don't be so angry, let's just get to our seats.",
112110,,Giana,But I'm very happy to know you're willing to drop the gentle act for me.,
112201,Auditorium-2,Giana,It's already halftime. I didn't notice the time passing so fast.,
112202,,*,"It seems you're really enjoying it, even though it's the show by other performers.",
112203,,Giana,"Dancing has almost become instinct to me, so I couldn't help to compare and learn from all the dance moves of others.",
112204,,Giana,I never thought you would like to see this kind of show... Maybe I should learn some of that.,
112205,,Giana,Beautiful? What do you think of my tails?,
112206,,*,Tails? I thought we're talking about the show.,
112207,,Giana,"Yes, THE SHOW! NOT THE ACTRESS!!!!",
112208,,Giana,"Senpai, I didn't play this even once...",
112301,Auditorium-3,Giana,"After a moment, the demon will appear from the left side of the stage and try to attract the prince by disguising herself the daughter of white swan.",
112302,,Giana,She will perform 32-fouettes continuously.,
112303,,Giana,"Senpai, why are you not responding?... Sorry, I shouldn't speak too much.",
112304,,Giana,???!!! It's very embarrassing to hear that! But I still feel very happy.,
112305,,Giana,Maybe you can come to my studio and dance with me more regularly. I've got many things to teach you.,
112306,,Giana,So... I was speaking too much... I should keep my mouth shut...,
113101,Souvenir Store-1,Shopkeeper,"Posters of superstars, autographs from famous singers, you name it, we have it!",
113102,,*,"It's a souvenir store, do you want anything?",
113103,,Shopkeeper,Come and take a look. I strongly recommend this stage badge set!,
113104,,Giana,But I prefer this folding fan. It's also more useful during summer days.,
113105,,Giana,"Okay, maybe you're right~",
113106,,Giana,"Senpai, you really know me so well, so I believe you also know that I like you too.",
113107,,Giana,But it will be a waste of money... I only need one...,
113201,Souvenir Store-2,*,"This is a really big souvenir store, maybe we can spend more time here.",
113202,,Shopkeeper,"Please take your time, we've got a various amounts of merchandise in stock, even including souvenirs of retired actresses.",
113203,,Giana,"Oh, maybe we will see... Senpai, maybe we should leave now~",
113204,,*,"What? Why? Giana, is that your picture on that wall~",
113205,,Giana,This is what I was trying to avoid... This is the photo for a new TV series in the past.,
113206,,Giana,Why did they zoom in this close anyway... They even show my pores in the picture...,
113207,,Giana,"!!! Senpai, you're getting too close!",
113208,,Giana,"Senpai, please don't do this anymore! (Face turns red)",
113209,,Giana,"But I'm standing right here, so you can just look at me.",
113301,Souvenir Store-3,*,"Even after saying you've let go of your past, you still purchased each type of your souvenirs...",
113302,,Giana,...Oh! I didn't notice I've bought so many... Does it bother you?,
113303,,*,No! It's a pleasure to pay just to make you smile~,
113304,,Giana,"If you have to choose just one of the souvenirs, which one would you choose?",
113305,,Giana,"If you chose this just to see me up close, you can just come to my home more often~",
113306,,Giana,"Bingo, it is small but it has all the details, I also love it a lot~",
113307,,*,"If I can place it in my room, it will feel like you're always standing my my side.",
113308,,Giana,"Well... Judging from the relationship we're in, that's something a pervert would say.",
113309,,Giana,This is actually useless since I've retired as a dancer...,
113310,,Giana,"Wait, my costume on the board is too embarrassing... Put it away!",
114101,Backstage-1,Actress A,Giana? Why are you here today? Are you here to watch our show?,
114102,,Actress B,"This is my first show, I was hoping you could be here. It's so happy to see my dream come true.",
114103,,*,"Giana, looks like you're very popular among the juniors~",
114104,,Actress A,"Giana, is this your...?",
114105,,Actresses,!!! We knew you were a couple!,
114106,,Giana,"Senpai, don't lie to them~ We're not a couple yet~",
114107,,Actresses,A friend close enough to come watch our show together? Very suspicious...,
114108,,Giana,Senpai! We're absolutely closer than normal friends!,
114109,,Giana,Stop! You're mine and mine alone! I won't share you with the others.,
114201,Backstage-2,Actress A,"Please take a seat, we've got so many questions~",
114202,,Actress B,"Give her a rest. She's not here to answer our questions, but maybe we can help with your makeup. We can show you how we improved this way.",
114203,,Giana,"It's fine by me, let's see how much you have learned~ Maybe Senpai can help to think of a theme for the makeup.",
114204,,Actress A,"Black swan represents beauty and the untamed, you always attracted all the attention in the past with this makeup.",
114205,,Giana,"Stop it, now I only want to attract the attention of... a special someone.",
114206,,Actress B,How about this? Senpai is surely impressed by this fairy-like Giana~,
114207,,*,I agree... She's extremely beautiful right now...,
114208,,Giana,Really? I'm so happy to know that,
114209,,Actress A,"Senpai's face turns red, he must be very charmed by Giana!",
114210,,Giana,"Senpai, are you alright? I hope you didn't catch a cold, come closer and let me feel your neck.",
114301,Backstage-3,Actress A,"Giana, are you still practicing dancing after the farewell performance? I'm also about to have my farewell performance, and I don't know what to do in the future.",
114302,,Giana,"Everyday, I don't stop dancing even if I'm not on the stage.",
114303,,Giana,What about Senpai? Do you have a hobby or goal for your life?,
114304,,Giana,It's a gentle response that works anywhere but here.,
114305,,Giana,That's not acceptable. How can you let yourself go like this?,
114306,,Giana,"I also hope every day can be peaceful and happy like today, with Senpai, of course.",
115101,Stage-1,*,"It seems the performance is over, everyone is leaving now. Giana, let's get out of here.",
115102,,Giana,"Wait... Senpai, it means the stage is free right...?",
115103,,Giana,"If possible, I want to be on the stage...",
115104,,*,And dance?,
115105,,Giana,Yes! And I hope you will be my only audience.,
115106,,Giana,Incomprehensible!,
115107,,Giana,"Senpai, you're flattering me, but please enjoy my dance.",
115108,,Giana,"Don't bother, even without the help of the light, my dance is still worthy enough to impress the audience. Especially to you.",
115201,Stage-2,*,You dance even nicer on this stage~,
115202,,Giana,Is that so? This is the first time I dance on this stage for only one person.,
115203,,*,It's my honor. Your farewell performance tickets were sold out in one minute.,
115204,,Giana,"It's also the best memory I have on stage... But now, the days are gone.",
115205,,Giana,"But even if I can, there are no longer any shows I can do.",
115206,,Giana,"No one can reverse time... Besides, I'm already very happy to have you by my side.",
115207,,Giana,"Senpai... You don't need to comfort me like this... Besides, if I cannot even win the applause from the last audience...",
115208,,*,Are you saying my applause means nothing?,
115209,,Giana,"Senpai, don't make a conceptual switch!",
115210,,*,"Haha, I was just kidding. I just wanted to make you smile more.",
115301,Stage-3,*,"The dance is over, now come down from the stage. Watch out for the stairs.",
115302,,Giana,"Don't worry, Senpai. I've come down this stage a thousand.... Oh!",
115303,,,What I worried has happened. Giana steps on her long dress when coming down the stage... She's about to fall on the ground!,
115304,,,"Yet, Giana still holds her balance, and stepped down.",
115305,,Giana,Senpai... You don't have to be this worried. Keeping balance is basic knowledge all dancers have...,
115306,,*,My bad. I just didn't want any chance of you being hurt.,
115307,,Giana,Senpai... Please let go a little bit. You're holding me too tight... I'm losing my breath...,
115308,,*,Sorry! It's my bad. Please forgive me!,
115309,,Giana,"Don't worry, I'm very happy to know you would take the risk to protect me~",
201101,Ferris Wheel -1,*,"Fencer, over here~",
201102,,Fencer,"What is this again? Just so you know, I won't get on a machine that looks dangerous, and neither should you!",
201103,,*,It's a Ferris wheel~ It's safe and you'll be able to see the entire city on it.,
201104,,Fencer,Safe? But this is the tallest thing in this amusement park. What if we get stuck at the top?,
201105,,Fencer,That's your perfect plan? But I'm not going to put my safety in the hands of others.,
201106,,Fencer,Luck... You think it's lucky?,
201107,,*,Of course! If you come with me the luck will be doubled!,
201108,,Fencer,What's this? Are you relying on me to keep you safe?,
201109,,*,Of course! I believe you can protect me from all dangers.,
201110,,Fencer,That's a strange theory...,
201201,Ferris Wheel -2,,"After several attempts to convince her, Fencer gets on the Ferris wheel with me.",
201202,,Fencer,"I'm just warning you, don't laugh or shout loudly when we get to the top. I don't want to be stared at by everyone here.",
201203,,*,Huh? Why would you even think that would happen? I don't even have a fear of heights!,
201204,,Fencer,"I said... It's just a warning, now let's take our seats.",
201205,,Fencer,"Senpai, where're you looking at?",
201206,,*,The city... Of course,
201207,,Fencer,I believe you can be more comfortable on the opposite side.,
201208,,*,I just want to be closer to you~ I won't be able to see you up close over there.,
201209,,Fencer,"(Face turns red) Nonsense... I didn't even put on makeup, why do you need to watch me up close?",
201301,Ferris Wheel -3,,"As our cabin goes higher, the scenery improves.",
201302,,*,"Fencer, look over there, it's our Academy!",
201303,,Fencer,"It's my first time seeing Yume Academy like this~ It feels strange, as it feels totally new to me but I've actually been studying there for a long time. Ohh!!!!",
201304,,,"All of a sudden, Fencer panics and curls up her body in the corner of our cabin.",
201305,,*,Fencer? Are you alright?,
201306,,Fencer,It's... It's too high for me...,
201307,,Fencer,"As it turns out I'm the one who has a fear of heights, pretty ironic isn't it?",
201308,,*,What are you talking about? Just ignore the height and concentrate on the beautiful sight of the sunset.,
201309,,*,"Take a deep breath, do you feel any better now?",
201310,,Fencer,"Sorry... Senpai, I shouldn't have said that to you. I was just trying to make you believe I don't have a fear of heights.",
201311,,*,Did you say anything? I don't remember that at all.,
201312,,*,"If you feel scared, let me describe the view for you. The sun is setting down and...",
201313,,Fencer,"...Senpai, you really are a bad narrator.",
202101,Carousel -1,*,Fencer? Do you want to go on this?,
202102,,Fencer,"If my memory serves me right, this is called a carousel... I think I would be described childish if I participated.",
202103,,*,"Why don't you think it over? I think you definitely want to, I can tell from your eyes.",
202104,,Fencer,"Senpai, don't think wrongly, besides... There are only children lining up.",
202105,,Fencer,"Although I want... I mean I should care, that's what a knight should do.",
202106,,*,"What knight are you talking about? You're now dating me, so I'm the only thing you need to care about.",
202107,,Fencer,"Huh? Senpai, what are you talking about? You... It doesn't matter! (Face turns red)",
202108,,Fencer,"Okay, if you insist.",
202109,,Fencer,Uh... I don't know much about stuff outside of fencing... But I think it wouldn't hurt to try.,
202201,Carousel -2,,"Finally, Fencer overcomes her self-consciousness and begins lining up.",
202202,,Fencer,Senpai... Don't tell anyone else about this...,
202203,,*,What? Tell others what? About the carousel?,
202204,,Fencer,Uh... I mean...,
202205,,*,What is it anyway? You're starting to make me curious.,
202206,,Kid,"Mommy, are they a couple? They're flirting with each other just like in the movie I saw.",
202207,,Fencer,"So... Senpai, you're really ""experienced""...",
202208,,Fencer,"Senpai, you can't say something like that, it's just like you're admitting it...",
202209,,*,Huh? I didn't admit anything? Why do you look so angry?,
202210,,Fencer,"But... ""A long way to go"" sounds like we're still working on it...",
202211,,Fencer,Huh? Lower the standards... Do you mean I'm not qualified? And a relationship cannot be admitted by the people in question.,
202301,Carousel -3,*,Are you angry about my answer?,
202302,,Fencer,"No, I'm not. The education I had won't allow me to get angry for this reason.",
202303,,*,"That's good to know, I thought you get angry as I denied our relationship... And now let's choose our seats.",
202304,,Fencer,Why do you want to put so much thought into it? We should just randomly pick one.,
202305,,*,Then let me choose for you.,
202306,,Fencer,"I'm starting to feel sad about this... We're so close but can't touch each other, as if there's a world separating us.",
202307,,Fencer,"There are still many seats unoccupied, are you sure you want to sit here?",
202308,,*,"In the legend, the two people who take these seats will live happy lives.",
202309,,Fencer,Really? It doesn't seem like a lie you made up just to make me feel happy...,
202310,,Fencer,Why is this in a carousel? I thought there'd only be wooden horses.,
202311,,*,"So that we can sit closer~ And let me serve you as a coachman of the princess, so please enjoy~",
203101,Ice Cream Cart -1,*,"Perfect, an ice cream cart appears just when the day is getting hotter. Do you want some?",
203102,,Fencer,Ice cream... Sounds like some kind of dessert.,
203103,,*,"Kind of, it's cold and tasty, I cannot think of anything better on a hot summer day.",
203104,,Fencer,"This dessert, I mean ice cream, must be pricy... I don't think it's necessary to waste all that money.",
203105,,Fencer,Senpai... What are you talking about?... I meant to say I don't need dessert.,
203106,,Fencer,Why?... I think it would be frugal.,
203107,,*,But we are on a date. A DATE! Thus doing anything that makes you feel bad would be a failure on my part.,
203108,,Fencer,"Is that proper, giving someone else what you bought for me?",
203109,,*,"So you will take it, right?",
203201,Ice Cream Cart -2,*,"Just come here, which ice cream would you like to have?",
203202,,Fencer,"Matcha, mango, strawberry, vanilla... and ice cream in customized shapes...",
203203,,*,"Looks like there are too many to choose from. Fencer, you just need to choose the one you like the most~",
203204,,Fencer,"It might take me a few minutes... You can make your choice first, Senpai.",
203205,,Fencer,Strawberry? The ice cream looks like a piece of pink cloud... Maybe I should also try this.,
203206,,Fencer,Huh? Customers can mix and match flavors here?,
203207,,*,That's right. You can take this if you want to try it~ I'd say it's a perfect combination~,
203208,,Fencer,"Oh, I will try it then.",
203209,,*,"Take a guess, what shape did I customize my ice cream into?",
203210,,Fencer,Why should I guess that?... I will know when it's completed.,
203211,,*,"Don't be so serious... Ta-Da! It's sword-shaped ice cream, pretty similar to your sword, right?",
203301,Ice Cream Cart -3,*,"Ice cream is good, right?",
203302,,Fencer,Well... I'd say it's delicious.,
203303,,*,I suggest you eat faster in case it melts.,
203304,,Fencer,"But for my health's sake, I should take it slowly... Oops...",
203305,,Fencer,"Senpai... Sorry, I should have listened to you.",
203306,,*,"No, I should apologize as you're the only person that was affected because of this.",
203307,,Fencer,But this was a gift from you... I should have cherished it more...,
203308,,Fencer,"This smells like perfume, was this a gift from another girl?",
203309,,*,"Perfume? No! This is my own handkerchief, I just cleaned it up with special detergent yesterday for this date.",
203310,,Fencer,"Huh? Senpai, what are you doing?",
203311,,*,Oh... I just want to wipe off the stain for you...,
204101,Roller Coaster -1,*,Rollercoasters have almost become icons of each amusement park. Let's give it a try~,
204102,,Fencer,"Senpai... Wait, did you hear the screams of those visitors? They sound like they're getting murdered...",
204103,,*,"Don't worry, that's not it~ The rollercoaster here is highly rated, it would be a pity if you didn't give it a try.",
204104,,Fencer,I see... But it still seems horrible to me...,
204105,,Fencer,"Nonsense! I'm not afraid... I just stopped you in case of an accident. But if you insist on trying, I won't stop you.",
204106,,Fencer,"Senpai, you're not going for it?",
204107,,*,"I want to, but since you don't look happy about it, let's just leave~",
204108,,Fencer,"But... You looked really happy once you saw it... I-I'm not afraid at all, let's get into the queue.",
204201,Roller Coaster -2,,"Despite Fencer claimed that she isn't afraid, she still shakes with every step she takes.",
204202,,*,I guess we'd better just leave.,
204203,,Fencer,"Don't... Senpai, please don't worry about me...",
204204,,Fencer,"Uh... Senpai, please don't find excuses for me... Besides, I can't have heatstroke because I can control ice.",
204205,,Fencer,"So you were just pretending to be excited? Senpai, you should just tell me you're afraid next time.",
204206,,*,"Yes, I know, also, this rule works well on everyone~",
204207,,Fencer,Senpai! Stop being enigmatic!,
204208,,Fencer,No... That's not what I mean...,
204209,,*,"Actually I need to go to the washroom now, can you wait for me?",
204210,,Fencer,Senpai... You don't need to speak it aloud...,
204301,Roller Coaster -3,Fencer,Senpai... I guess you really want to take that rollercoaster...,
204302,,*,"Not really. I can visit this amusement part any time I want, but my time with you is limited.",
204303,,Fencer,Sorry... It is all my fault... What should I do to make it up to you?,
204304,,*,"Actually there's another roller coaster in this amusement park, but smaller~ I believe it won't be that scary for you~",
204305,,Fencer,Really?... Alright then...,
204306,,*,"Of course it's not~ (But it is designed for the kids, I can only imagine how embarrassed she will look like when standing amongst them.)",
204307,,Fencer,I hope it's less horrible than the roller coaster.,
204308,,*,You'll soon find out…,
204309,,,After getting off the corsair,
204310,,*,How do you feel?,
204311,,Fencer,Well... It's okay... Now I'm realizing roller coasters aren't that bad.,
204312,,*,"I mean, it's not too late to go back to the other one.",
204313,,Fencer,Wait... I... I was just saying... (throws up),
204314,,*,"Tighten up your raincoat, otherwise you will get wet...",
204315,,Fencer,That sounds troublesome... Do we have to do this?,
204316,,*,It's your idea to make it up to me. Are you going to go back on your word?,
204317,,Fencer,No... I'm just worried the water will ruin my clothes and hair...,
204318,,*,"Your clothes will be safe if you properly wear the raincoat, and I believe you will still look gorgeous if your hair gets wet.",
205101,Haunted House -1,Fencer,Senpai... Is this... A haunted house?... Why are we here?,
205102,,*,The answer is pretty obvious--- Play!,
205103,,Fencer,Can we just leave?,
205104,,*,"But it's almost our turn, it would be a waste to leave now after waiting in line for so long.",
205105,,Girl,"Senpai, can you stand in front of me after we enter? I think I can stay calm with you protecting me.",
205106,,Fencer,"But... Senpai, isn't this a date between you and me?",
205107,,Fencer,"Priority... Stop kidding! Besides, that's really embarrassing and I don't need your protection...",
205108,,*,So you're going to enter the haunted house with me?,
205109,,Fencer,Just this time…,
205110,,Fencer,What are you talking about? Am I supposed to influence your decisions?,
205111,,*,But we're on a date now. Are you letting your mate go for others?,
205112,,Fencer,"No, that cannot happen... This is disrespectful to both you and me.",
205201,Haunted House -2,*,"Fencer, are you ready?",
205202,,Fencer,Yes...,
205203,,*,"So, here we go~",
205204,,Fencer,S-Senpai...,
205205,,Fencer,Senpai... What are you doing?,
205206,,*,"Take my hand, that will stop you from getting scared.",
205207,,Fencer,Thank you...,
205208,,Fencer,????(Face turns red) Senpai! How can you do this without my permission?,
205209,,*,"Sorry, I just lost control of my hand. But now you're holding my hands real tight.",
205210,,Fencer,??? SENPAI!!!! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?,
205211,,*,"I'm hugging you, as you might have noticed. Are you getting angry?",
205212,,Fencer,(Face turns red) No... It's okay...,
205213,,*,"Now you don't feel afraid anymore, yes?",
205301,Haunted House -3,*,I heard there is a special performance?,
205302,,Staff,"Yes, we will provide customized surprises for you and your girlfriend if you purchase the DLC for this journey.",
205303,,*,"Sorry, you've mistaken our relationship... And what does DLC mean?",
205304,,,After entering the haunted house,
205305,,Fencer,"Oh, it's not that horrible after all... Sorry for being so nervous and hold your hand so tight, hope you're not hurt",
205306,,*,"Don't worry, I won't be hurt so easily... But I feel a bit disappointed.",
205307,,,After entering the haunted house,
205308,,Fencer,AHHHHHHH!!!,
205309,,*,What happened?,
205310,,Fencer,I just stepped on something slimy and couldn't shake it off... So I had to freeze it.,
205311,,*,God bless the poor staff,
205312,,,After entering the haunted house,
205313,,*,Fencer? Are you alright? You're making me worried.,
205314,,Fencer,Slimy tentacles... Blood dropping on my face... And human parts all over the place... This is hell!,
205315,,*,"(Oh no, that was too much)",
205316,,Fencer,"Thank god... I've got you here with me, Senpai!",
206101,Clothing Store -1,Fencer,"Senpai, why are we here? I don't need any new clothes...",
206102,,*,"Your appearance today doesn't seem to support your theory. Besides, no one would refuse clothes that are fashionable and beautiful.",
206103,,Fencer,My appearance today?... Do I look strange to you?,
206104,,Fencer,"Thanks for the compliment, I actually didn't waste too much time.",
206105,,Fencer,(Whispers) Thank god you like it...,
206106,,*,What did you say?,
206107,,Fencer,"No, nothing...",
206108,,Fencer,That's all?... I was waiting for a... Compliment… (Whispers),
206201,Clothing Store -2,Shop Assistant,"Welcome, please check out our merchandise~",
206202,,*,"Look, I believe the dress in the showcase suits you well, maybe you can try it on?",
206203,,Shop Assistant,"Great choice, it's a new style this season.",
206204,,Fencer,But... It looks too...,
206205,,Shop Assistant,Is this one too conservative for you? What about that one? It will expose more of your body!,
206206,,Fencer,"Uh... Maybe not, I will just take this one.",
206207,,*,"If you don't like this one, I think that one will also suit you well.",
206208,,Fencer,Senpai... Your fashion sense shocks me... I'd rather try the first one.,
206209,,*,"It's a pity, I don't think anyone else would look as good in this dress than you would~",
206210,,Fencer,Senpai... Are you serious about that?,
206211,,Shop Assistant,Of course! You can count on the review of your boyfriend and a professional!,
206212,,Fencer,Okay... I'll give it a try...,
206301,Clothing Store -3,Shop Assistant,"As predicted, you look gorgeous in this!",
206302,,Fencer,I still feel a bit uncomfortable... I think my everyday outfit suits me better.,
206303,,Shop Assistant,Maybe your boyfriend can answer that for you~,
206304,,Fencer,"Okay, maybe I should just ignore the discomfort and trust you.",
206305,,Fencer,Really? I'm happy to know that Senpai has the same tastes as I do.,
206306,,Fencer,It's really a pity...,
207101,Cat Café -1,Fencer,Cat café? What's the difference between that and a normal café?,
207102,,*,"As the name suggests, there are cats in it. But isn't this the correct location? It's not here...",
207103,,Fencer,Café with cats... Is it over there?,
207104,,Cat on the road,Meow~,
207105,,*,"Oh, it's a feral cat.",
207106,,Fencer,"She's not trying to run away, must be hungry…",
207107,,Fencer,"Cat food... Senpai, why do you carry this around... Is that a habit of yours?",
207108,,*,"Just in case we get into some kind of situation like this. Besides, being able to feed cats by your own hand is really a great experience.",
207109,,Fencer,I see... I didn't even know you're a cat person... I like cats too.,
207110,,Fencer,What's this?,
207111,,*,"It's a boiled egg, I prepared this for my breakfast... Hope she'll like it...",
207112,,Fencer,"I think we will need to tear the egg into pieces and then... Good girl, take your time~",
207113,,*,"I never knew Fencer loved cats this much, she looks completely different than usual~",
207114,,*,"I didn't bring any food today, sorry about that...",
207115,,Fencer,"Looks like we can't help you this time, sorry~",
207201,Cat Café -2,*,"Huh, is the cat trying to lead us somewhere? Oh, the cat café is right over there.",
207202,,Fencer,So she was from this cat café all along? Maybe she was out there just to guide customers like us...,
207203,,Waitress,"Welcome, would you want to try our accompany-a-kitty service? You can choose any cat you want~",
207204,,Fencer,"Ah, the British breed~ I've kept one before, although cats of her kind are not as energetic as others, but they are really good listeners.",
207205,,*,"Is that so? (Turn to the cat) Come here then, let me tell you a secret~",
207206,,Fencer,Why you are speaking to a cat? Is it a secret I cannot know?,
207207,,*,"Well, the secret is about you.",
207208,,Fencer,She has very beautiful eyes.,
207209,,*,But I don't think she's happy to play with us…,
207210,,Fencer,"Pride is in a Persian cats' instinct. So just take it easy, I know she likes us.",
207211,,*,"Noble and proud, she's like you, Fencer...",
207212,,Fencer,"We meet again, let's build a closer relationship~",
207213,,*,She's really clingy. She even started to sleep right next to you.,
207214,,Fencer,I never knew I'm so popular among cats~,
207215,,*,"Don't underestimate yourself, you're not popular among ONLY cats~",
207301,Cat Café -3,Waitress,How did you like our services?,
207302,,Fencer,"It's awesome, these cats are so cute!",
207303,,Waitress,"I'm glad to hear that! If you want to return here more often, I suggest you purchase a membership card for special services.",
207304,,*,Special services? What exactly are those?,
207305,,Waitress,You can check it out on our brochure.,
207306,,Waitress,You will be able to choose three cats and double the time you stay for each visit~,
207307,,Fencer,"Oh my god! I'm already starting to get excited just by imagining that, a paradise full of cats~",
207308,,*,"Fencer, you look very happy about this idea.",
207309,,Fencer,Yes I am! Thank you so much!,
207310,,Waitress,You will be able to choose one cat and double the time you stay for each visit~,
207311,,*,So this membership will only extend the time we stay？ I'm actually pretty disappointed about this...,
207312,,Fencer,"Don't worry, I'm already happy enough to know I can be here more often~ Maybe I should start thinking of of which cat should I choose next time.",
207313,,Fencer,"No?... Senpai, you don't like cats? It's a pity that I'll have to come alone next time.",
208101,Afternoon Tea -1,Fencer,It's...,
208102,,*,"This is my idea. Since you've been practicing Fencing all day long, you must also have some knowledge about afternoon tea.",
208103,,Fencer,Uh... Not really...,
208104,,*,Sorry... Maybe we should go to somewhere else…,
208105,,Fencer,Don't bother... We've been walking for a while and I could use the rest.,
208106,,Waitress,"Welcome, please choose the seat you want to take.",
208107,,Fencer,It feels nice to be able to watch the crowd pass by through the window...,
208108,,*,It's really hard to relax these days.,
208109,,Fencer,"I spent almost my entire life practicing Fencing... This is actually my first time having such a relaxed afternoon. Thank you, Senpai.",
208110,,*,"Just relax, you've said enough ""Thank you""s today.",
208111,,Fencer,We're the only customers indoors...,
208112,,*,"Most people will choose the seats outdoors or near the window, thus making this space only for you and I.",
208113,,Fencer,Please stop acting so weird... That's just a coincidence!!!,
208114,,Fencer,Here? But there are so many people around...,
208115,,Waitress,"Since you didn't choose a specific seat, we just choose the location randomly, if you have any special requirement, we'll pick another seat for you.",
208116,,Fencer,"No... Don't bother, this place is fine.",
208201,Afternoon Tea -2,Waitress,"If this is your first time visiting our restaurant. I'd recommend the fruit tart, it won't let you down.",
208202,,Fencer,"But for afternoon tea, scones are actually a more classic choice.",
208203,,Waitress,"It is true that scone is the most regular choice for afternoon teas, but the taste is not special. This is the reason we recommend you our special fruit tart.",
208204,,Fencer,It makes sense... But it still feels strange to have afternoon tea without scones.,
208205,,Waitress,"This is a good idea, this set not only contains scones and fruit tarts, but also some sandwiches in case you want to have something salty.",
208206,,Fencer,"So you are just spending more money to avoid making a choice?... Pretty lame, I'd say...",
208207,,*,No! I just want to try different things…,
208208,,Fencer,"Senpai, you don't need to defend yourself, I was a bit too mean.",
208209,,Fencer,"Just tear a scone apart, and then smear some jam and cream on it.",
208210,,*,You don't seem to be so clueless about afternoon tea at all... Nom nom nom...,
208211,,Fencer,"So, how does it taste? It's been a long time since I last tasted a scone... Uh...",
208212,,*,So... I think it is too...,
208213,,Fencer,"It's too dry... This is really a bad choice, sorry for that.",
208214,,Fencer,"Senpai, don't you trust me?",
208215,,*,"Nononono, I just think the fruits on this tart could better soothe your appetite~ Just try one of these, I think they taste really good~",
208216,,Fencer,If you say so…,
208217,,*,How does it taste?,
208218,,Fencer,Delicious! Maybe I should be more open to new ideas next time.,
208301,Afternoon Tea -3,Fencer,"Senpai, there are rules for afternoon tea.",
208302,,*,And someone said she doesn't know that at all~,
208303,,*,"But now, I think I should just leave it behind and let you teach me.",
208304,,Fencer,"I was just trying to avoid making myself look overly confident... But since you're asking, tell me which should you add to the cup first, tea or milk?",
208305,,Fencer,"This ensures the temperature of the tea won't ruin the cup, but will ruin the original flavor of tea.",
208306,,Fencer,This way you will be able to add milk according to your tastes more accurately.,
208307,,*,"You've never been so talkative, now I'm sure you're really fond of afternoon tea.",
208308,,Fencer,Not only afternoon tea... But also the time I spend with you.,
208309,,Fencer,"Haha, that's totally milk tea. What a waste of tea.",
208310,,*,Why is it so strange? I think any kind of method will be fine as long as it can make you happy.,
208311,,Fencer,That's right. Enjoying life is the most important thing.,
209101,The Flower Shop -1,*,"Fencer, take a look, the flower in that flower shop are beautiful!",
209102,,Florist,We just picked them this morning. You can even see the dewdrops on them.,
209103,,Fencer,"Uh... I think that's a bad idea, I might accidentally freeze the flowers...",
209104,,Fencer,Why? I told you I might...,
209105,,*,"Don't worry too much, your sight won't shoot freezing lasers~",
209106,,Florist,"You really should improve your dating skills, no lady would refuse flowers!",
209107,,*,"Fencer, that mystic rose looks really nice, just go and take a look. I believe it will suit you well.",
209108,,Florist,"This is a very rare breed, and this one is the first blue rose we've found this year.",
209109,,Fencer,"Senpai, do you really think this flower suits me?",
209110,,*,"Of course. Plus, mystic roses grow on snowy mountains. I don't think they would be frozen~",
209111,,Fencer,If you say so...,
209201,The Flower Shop -2,,"Before we enter the flower shop, a girl crashes into me with tears on her face and a bunch of flowers in her hand.",
209202,,Girl,Sorry... (Sobs) I should have seen you...,
209203,,*,"No need to apologize. By the way, why do you look so sad?",
209204,,Girl,I failed to profess my love... I'm totally a loser!,
209205,,Girl,Now these flowers will be useless because of my failure...,
209206,,Girl,Wait... Maybe my flowers might help with your relationship.,
209207,,Girl,Why?,
209208,,Fencer,That's just too cruel. I think it's harmless to accept the flowers.,
209209,,*,"Even though, accepting them during our date might hurt you.",
209210,,Girl,So you're willing to take it?,
209211,,*,"Yes, I'd like to purchase the flowers from you. All flowers deserves a good place, as do you.",
209212,,Fencer,Senpai is always so gentle to everyone~,
209213,,Girl,Thank you very much... I'm happy to know the emotions I entrusted on the flowers can be passed on.,
209214,,Fencer,So... Accepting the flower means accepting the emotion that one entrusts into it?,
209215,,*,So... Will you now accept this flower from me?,
209216,,Fencer,Huh? Me?... That's unexpected...,
209301,The Flower Shop -3,Fencer,"Rose, campanula, lily... This flower shop has them all.",
209302,,*,You're so knowledgeable about flowers.,
209303,,Fencer,Maybe you can guess which flower I like the most.,
209304,,Fencer,"It's true that Mystic Rose is a rare breed, but I think it's too rare for me.",
209305,,Fencer,"Just like the color suggests, the flower stands for the intensity of love. Unfortunately, I'm not so good at expressing my love.",
209306,,Fencer,That's right...,
209307,,*,"Well, this is actually a surprising answer to me.",
209308,,Fencer,The flower stands for courage. Sometimes I even think I share the same specialty with it. How do you feel?,
209309,,*,"Actually, you being tough is the actual reasons others keep a distance from you.",
209310,,Fencer,"Just like the petals of the flower, it needs but a chance to open up.",
210101,Rest -1,*,Why don't we sit here and have a rest? You must be tired after this long walk.,
210102,,Fencer,"Actually I'm not that tired, but thanks... Senpai, you really care a lot about us.",
210103,,*,Huh? I feel I've heard something like this elsewhere...,
210104,,Fencer,"You always treat every one of us so gently, that's why you would've heard something similar.",
210105,,Fencer,Is that it? I was expecting more...,
210106,,Fencer,Did I say anything that troubles you?,
210107,,Fencer,"I can't say I'm unhappy to know that, but to be fair, I'd say it's unfair for other girls.",
210201,Rest -2,*,"After this long walk, you must be thirsty. Do you need anything to drink?",
210202,,Fencer,Drink? But I didn't bring any water...,
210203,,*,"You're missing my point, I was just asking if you're thirsty.",
210204,,Fencer,"Actually I feel a bit of thirsty, but I don't think I can drink without water.",
210205,,Fencer,"Have you used the bottle yet?... Sorry, I cannot take that then... No, not because of health reasons, but…",
210206,,Fencer,Even if the convenience store is not far away... I believe you will feel bad under the sun.,
210207,,*,"Don't worry, it's nothing to me~",
210208,,Fencer,Then at least let me cast a spell to cool you down.,
210209,,Fencer,Is the soft-drink bar right over there? They sell those colorful pops?,
210210,,*,"Yes it is, would you come with me?",
210211,,Fencer,I think the pop will taste better after icing it with my magic.,
210301,Rest -3,*,"Honestly, I thought you'd refuse my invitation.",
210302,,Fencer,I rarely went out of the Academy because of the lack of knowledge about society...,
210303,,Fencer,But I wouldn't say no to your invitation...,
210304,,Fencer,An itinerary list... You've prepared this much for our date? Actually I also prepared a bit…,
210305,,Fencer,"Is this for me? But I don't think it's necessary... I'm already grateful enough to get an invitation from you, besides, I don't have a gift for you in return.",
210306,,*,"I don't need a gift in return, just take it~",
210307,,Fencer,"But I still feel uncomfortable accepting a gift with nothing in return. Sorry, I cannot take it.",
210308,,Fencer,Senpai...!!! What are you doing?! What? Can you better express your emotions by holding my hand?,
211101,Candy Apple Store -1,Fencer,Senpai…,
211102,,*,"Fencer, what is it? Oh, it's candy apples, do you want one?",
211103,,Fencer,Yes... The red candy apple looks really cute...,
211104,,*,"You also look very cute when seeing something you like, so let's get one.",
211105,,Fencer,Cute...,
211106,,Fencer,"Senpai, just stop... I don't think I can be called cute…",
211107,,Fencer,"What are you talking about... Cute or gorgeous, these are praises I don't deserve to get.",
211108,,*,That's not true... You are actually very beautiful.,
211109,,Fencer,I'm just not used to compliments... But if you insist to give them... I think I have no reason to stop you.,
211201,Candy Apple Store -2,Fencer,"Senpai, do you know that candy apples are used to be called toffee apples? And they were originally designed for Christmas.",
211202,,*,"Is that so? I thought it was just like other normal candies... You sure know a lot about this, Fencer.",
211203,,Fencer,That's not important. At least not as important as the candy apple in your hand.,
211204,,Fencer,I guess you only bit the surface.,
211205,,*,I think it's too sweet for me.,
211206,,Fencer,"I suggest you take one more bite, the apple inside will balance the sweetness of the icing.",
211207,,Fencer,"You must have bit the icing and the apple inside together, thus the apple's sourness balances the sweetness of icing.",
211208,,*,That's how it supposed to taste? Just like the feeling of falling in love.,
211209,,Fencer,How can that be? The icing should balance the sourness.,
211210,,*,"I don't know why, but it tastes really sour. You can give it a try if you don't believe me.",
211211,,Fencer,"Strange... Let me taste it... Uh, it's not so sour...",
211301,Candy Apple Store -3,*,"Fencer, the corner of your mouth...",
211302,,Fencer,Huh?,
211303,,Fencer,Was it my misconception or are you staring at me more than usual? Is there anything on my face?,
211304,,*,I just think you look gorgeous.,
211305,,Fencer,I've told you not to say that again...,
211306,,Fencer,Huh? There's icing there? I think that's why I felt bit of uncomfortable after finishing the candy apple.,
211307,,Fencer,"Thanks for telling me, please excuse me for a while.",
211308,,Fencer,That's so nice of you~ I'll clean it up and return it to you later.,
211309,,*,I actually feel a bit sad after doing so. You look even more tempting with icing on your lip.,
211310,,Fencer,Shush! That's totally not SFW.,
212101,Fireworks Display -1,*,"It's getting dark, I suggest we go to the site now so we can get a good spot to watch the fireworks~",
212102,,Fencer,I agree.,
212103,,*,I guess you've also studied that a little bit.,
212104,,Fencer,I... I just did a quick preview... In case I don't know anything...,
212105,,*,You're too strict on yourself...,
212106,,Fencer,"So... Do you think it's a bad habit, Senpai?",
212107,,Fencer,I actually have some relaxation time when I feel tired...,
212108,,*,Such as?,
212109,,Fencer,Just like right now...,
212110,,Fencer,"Serious... That doesn't sound like a good thing... Besides, I don't want you to admire me, but to...",
212111,,Fencer,"Respect, that's not what I want...",
212112,,*,What?,
212113,,Fencer,I just hope you can... You can treat me more gently and...,
212201,Fireworks Display -2,,The crowd is approaching as we speak.,
212202,,Student,"Right over here! The fireworks display is about to begin, let's get a good spot.",
212203,,,"People are rushing from all directions, and we get separated by the crowd.",
212204,,Fencer,Senpai! Where are you? The crowd is pushing me away...,
212205,,*,"Don't worry, I'm always here.",
212206,,*,"Didn't see this coming, looks like we need to get through this difficulty together.",
212207,,Fencer,"Okay... I understand, I'll try my best.",
212208,,Fencer,Senpai... You're holding on too tight... Can't breathe...,
212209,,*,Sorry... (Let go),
212210,,Fencer,Uh... You didn't need to let go completely...,
212301,Fireworks Display -3,,"After struggling to get ourselves through the crowd, we can finally take a deep breath.",
212302,,*,I can't say that'll be a good memory... But I think we still have chance to watch the fireworks display.,
212303,,Fencer,Don't worry... We’ve made enough good memories today... Let's just think of a place for the fireworks display~,
212304,,Fencer,"Cannot think of anywhere that is closer to the fireworks... And to you, Senpai.",
212305,,Fencer,"Even if here is far away from the crowd, I can still feel the heat of the festival.",
212306,,Fencer,"And your heat too, Senpai~",
212307,,Fencer,"It's not bad... I mean, as long as you're standing next to me...",
213101,Takoyaki -1,Store keeper,Fresh takoyaki on sale!,
213102,,Fencer,"Oh, it's takoyaki...",
213103,,*,Do you know that too?,
213104,,Fencer,I do... It's also called octopus balls... Is that octopus whisker lying right over there?,
213105,,*,They're lying about the ingredients on the table... Guess they're really confident about their own product. Maybe we should try some?,
213106,,Fencer,If you want to...,
213107,,Fencer,"The basic taste? Well... Not so bad, please also try some of these, Senpai.",
213108,,*,These ones are covered with seaweed.,
213109,,Fencer,They make the flavor more complicated...,
213110,,*,How does it taste?,
213111,,Fencer,The spice stimulates the taste of octopus.,
213112,,*,Let me taste it... HHHHHHHHHHHHHOT! It's even spicier than mustard!!!,
213113,,Fencer,Is it? I don't think it's spicy at all...,
213114,,*,(Coughs)... I need... Water...,
213201,Takoyaki -2,Store keeper,You can also customize your own flavor with the sauces we provide.,
213202,,*,"There's a wide variety to choose from. Fencer, wanna give it a try?",
213203,,*,Delicious!!! Did you cast any magic onto it?,
213204,,Fencer,"I just made a simple combination with these. Senpai, you're overreacting.",
213205,,*,"Fencer, how does it taste? Is it delicious?",
213206,,Fencer,Well... The flavor is too complicated...,
213207,,*,Complicated? You mean it's delicious right? Let me check it out myself...,
213208,,*,Uh... You can just tell me it's nasty...,
213209,,*,The takoyaki itself is already delicious enough.,
213210,,Fencer,"Maybe that's true... But I was excited to try a flavor created by you, Senpai...",
213301,Takoyaki -3,*,"Finally, this is the last takoyaki. Fencer, you can take it.",
213302,,Fencer,"Don't worry about me, Senpai.",
213303,,*,"The last one is always the most delicious~ Fencer, sorry but I didn't mean to show off or anything.",
213304,,Fencer,"Don't worry, as long as you feel happy, it's fine by me.",
213305,,Fencer,Do you really want to give it to me?,
213306,,*,"Yes, it's rare to see you take an interest in something and I don't want to ruin your moment. Just eat up while it's warm.",
213307,,Fencer,"Okay... And thank you, Senpai.",
213308,,*,"Just separate it in half with the bamboo stick... Done and done, now we can share it. Fencer, just eat up while it's still warm~",
213309,,Fencer,"I have an idea... Senpai, open up your mouth please.",
213310,,*,"Open up? Like this? Huh, Fencer what are you... (Chewing)",
213311,,Fencer,"I think it'll be better to feed our halves to each other. Now it's your turn, Senpai~",
214101,Shaved Ice -1,Fencer,"Senpai, is that ice cream over there?",
214102,,*,"No, it's shaved ice.",
214103,,Fencer,It looks just the same to me.,
214104,,*,"Well... It has a similar taste, but they're very different.",
214105,,Girl,"A cup of shaved ice, please.",
214106,,Shop Owner,"Sorry, we only have the ingredients for one cup left...",
214107,,*,Looks like we need to leave and see if there's another store that sells the same thing.,
214108,,Fencer,But it's a pity to give up this early.,
214109,,*,"It might sound rude, but please leave this to me.",
214110,,Girl,Why should I?,
214111,,*,I can pay you whatever you want.,
214112,,Fencer,Senpai... You don't need to go this far...,
214113,,Girl,So... Each of us takes half of it?,
214114,,*,"That's right, it's not something that cannot be shared.",
214115,,Fencer,Hold on... Will we have to share a cup with her?,
214116,,*,"No, we'd let the storekeeper put our half in another cup.",
214117,,Fencer,Oh... I see.,
214201,Shaved Ice -2,Shop Owner,Which flavor do you want?,
214202,,Fencer,"Melon, strawberry, grape... All these are syrups?",
214203,,*,It will build the base flavor of your shaved ice. I heard they recently developed a brown sugar flavor.,
214204,,Shop Owner,"That's true, but we recommend melon flavor, that's our bestseller.",
214205,,*,How does it taste?,
214206,,Fencer,"Yes, there's still the smell of melon left. It tastes very fresh...",
214207,,*,Can I taste it too?,
214208,,Fencer,"Okay, just open your mouth, Senpai~",
214209,,*,How does it taste?,
214210,,Fencer,It's too sweet for me.,
214211,,*,Guess we've found out why the new flavor is not as popular.,
214212,,*,How does it taste? I thought using the syrup that is not made of fruit might be a nice experience.,
214213,,Fencer,"Well... I cannot describe how it feels exactly when shaved ice comes together with red mung beans... But it's really delicious~ Please give it a try, Senpai!",
214301,Shaved Ice -3,Fencer,What are they doing?,
214302,,*,"Well... I guess they're taking photos of the shaved ice. After all, it's something that would melt easily on summer days.",
214303,,*,"Fencer, I suggest you also eat yours quickly. It could start to melt soon.",
214304,,Fencer,Uh... Sorry but it's already started to melt from the bottom...,
214305,,*,"I suggest we just leave it here, it's no longer that delicious after melted.",
214306,,Fencer,"That's a good point... But I still feel bad, as Senpai put in a lot effort to get me this...",
214307,,*,I think the most important thing now is to eat up the part that isn't melted before it's too late.,
214308,,Fencer,"Sadly, feelings aren't that easy to give up, even if it is ""too late""…",
214309,,*,"Fencer, why don't you try to cast your ice magic? You can just freeze them again.",
214310,,Fencer,But... That won't make it crispy again. That process is irreversible.,
214311,,*,You've got a point... Why does this story sounds like a metaphor?,
215101,Ring Toss -1,*,"There's a ring toss game here, looks like the storekeeper has prepared many rewards.",
215102,,Shopkeeper,Come and give it a try. You can take a reward based on where you toss~,
215103,,Fencer,So all of these rewards are available?,
215104,,Shopkeeper,"Of course, as long as you can toss a ring onto the correct one!",
215105,,Fencer,"Huh? Senpai, what are you doing?",
215106,,*,"The storekeeper said whatever I toss a ring on, I can take home with me. If I toss it onto you, you have to come home with me.",
215107,,Fencer,"Huh? All of them? Senpai, what are you planning to do?",
215108,,*,This store won't be here every day. Let me have a good time.,
215109,,*,"Fencer, just go. The rings here are specially processed to make them hard to be tossed onto objects.",
215110,,Shopkeeper,Stop this slander and move along!,
215201,Ring Toss -2,Fencer,"Senpai, I really want that toy bear, so let me try.",
215202,,*,There's nothing you need to feel sorry about.,
215203,,Shopkeeper,"… It's already the 5th attempt, I suggest you try another target.",
215204,,Fencer,Uh...,
215205,,Shopkeeper,"Sorry, but these are not for sale...",
215206,,*,What about 5 times the price... Maybe 10 times!,
215207,,Shopkeeper,Alright then...,
215208,,*,"Thanks very much. Now go and take the bear, Fencer.",
215209,,Fencer,Huh? Is it for me?,
215210,,*,I believe you can take good care of it~,
215211,,Fencer,"Okay, I will... But I wanted to get it for you...",
215212,,Fencer,I'll try just a few more times!,
215213,,*,"Just toss left a little bit and then... Done! Fencer, you did it!",
215214,,*,"I think we should leave now, we've wasted too much time here~",
215215,,Fencer,Sorry about that...,
215301,Ring Toss -3,,"Fencer finally got her toy bear, but before we go our separate ways, she asks me to stop.",
215302,,Fencer,"Senpai... We had a wonderful date today... So, please take this toy bear...",
215303,,*,I'll cherish your present... And your love with it.,
215304,,Fencer,What are you talking about... I totally cannot understand that!,
215305,,Fencer,"That's a relief, I was worried that you wouldn't take it...",
215306,,*,That wouldn't happen... I just wanted to extend our time together…,
215307,,Fencer,... Stop being stupid...,
215308,,*,"Fencer, you spent so much effort on this toy bear, you'd better keep it for yourself.",
215309,,Fencer,"Senpai, you should really improve your EQ!!!",
301101,Lake Talk -1,*,"Look over there, there's a group of black swans.",
301102,,*,"I heard the Academy brought them in a few days ago, but I never thought I'd be lucky enough to meet them the first time I came to this lake. Seems my luck is also better with you around~",
301103,,KongMing,"Senpai, what do you think of the swans?",
301104,,*,Why do you ask?,
301105,,KongMing,"Nothing, I just want to get to know you more.",
301106,,KongMing,Grace... So Senpai likes graceful girls...,
301107,,*,Did you say something?,
301108,,KongMing,"Don't worry, I was just talking to myself.",
301109,,KongMing,"Haha, I believe you'll change your mind after you actually hear them.",
301110,,*,Huh? Is that rumor not true? That's pretty embarassing...,
301111,,KongMing,"Yes, they are.",
301112,,KongMing,Actually it would be nice to be a female swan living her life with her one and only love.,
301113,,*,Okay.. I think I understand what you want. I won't let you lose to a swan.,
301114,,KongMing,(Embarassed) Senpai... This ain't a competition...,
301201,Lake Talk -2,*,The breeze is making my walk with you even more comfortable.,
301202,,KongMing,Comfortable?... In the past you've said you feel a lot of pressure while you're with me...,
301203,,*,What are you saying?,
301204,,KongMing,"Nothing, I just got bitten by a mosquito. I think that is the only thing we need to worry about now.",
301205,,KongMing,A bump has appeared on KongMing's arm as we speak.,
301206,,KongMing,"Senpai, I believe you mean well.",
301207,,KongMing,"But don't be too worried, there won't be any mosquitos near rapid flows.",
301208,,*,"I don't know if it will work, but please try it out.",
301209,,KongMing,A mint satchet? Why would you bring this around?,
301210,,*,Well... I prepared this for our date... I thought you might like this...,
301211,,KongMing,I sure do...,
301212,,KongMing,What's this?,
301213,,*,"It's mosquito repellent, since we're having a date somewhere full of plants, I thought I'd come prepared.",
301214,,KongMing,"Senpai, you are so thoughtful, but don't forget to apply some on yourself too if you don't want to become the sole target of the mosquitos.",
301301,Lake Talk -3,*,"There's a bench, let's sit there and rest a little.",
301302,,KongMing,"Senpai, do you feel bored having a date in the park?",
301303,,*,"Why would I be? This is a perfect opportunity for us to get closer to nature... Besides, it's a pleasant feeling to see other people relaxing in the park.",
301304,,KongMing,"What kind of activity in park would you like the most, Senpai?",
301305,,*,"I love flying kites, and I've got a dream--- please don't laugh at me for this--- I sometimes feel like flying into the sky like a kite.",
301306,,KongMing,"It's hard to imagine that, because it might take a great amount of strength to make that happen.",
301307,,*,Huh? Are you making fun of me?,
301308,,*,It will be extremely fun to row a boat to the middle of the lake.,
301309,,KongMing,"Looks like Senpai and I share the same interests... I actually have a boat I secretly hid by this lake, maybe we can go on it today?",
301310,,*,Hide... A boat?... Isn't that against the rules?,
301311,,*,Nothing would be better than having a picnic on the grass to relax.,
301312,,KongMing,"It's good to hear that, it means we can go have a picnic under that tree.",
301313,,*,Uh... Does that means you've been planning for this all along?,
302101,Boating -1,KongMing,"Senpai, please wait here, I'll be right back...",
302102,,*,Huh? What are you going to do?,
302103,,KongMing,You'll soon find out.,
302104,,*,"Okay, if you say so.",
302105,,,"After I agreed to stay, KongMing rushed into a bush quickly, and it sounds like something's being moved.",
302106,,,"I accidentally stepped on a branch, which makes a loud sound. After that, KongMing shows up in front of me.",
302107,,KongMing,"Since you're so curious, come with me, I might need your help.",
302108,,*,A boat?! Were you trying to pull that out?,
302109,,KongMing,"Yes, and I will explain later, but first just help me pull it out.",
302110,,,"Because I tried to hide myself, KongMing doesn't notice me approaching and keeps trying to pull out her boat",
302111,,KongMing,Come on... I can do this...,
302112,,*,WE can do this.,
302113,,KongMing,Senpai?! Why are you here?,
302114,,*,Why did you stop? I cannot do this without your help~,
302115,,,"After a long time, KongMing returns looking tired.",
302116,,*,"KongMing, are you alright? You look really exhausted.",
302117,,KongMing,Senpai... You followed my instructions pretty well...,
302118,,*,"It's because you asked me to... But you don't look happy about that, did I do something wrong?",
302119,,KongMing,"No... Just come with me and check it out, we've got a boat to row now.",
302201,Boating -2,*,"If you let me know, I would've helped you.",
302202,,KongMing,It was meant to be a surprise.,
302203,,*,"Don't bother yourself this much, you just need to enjoy yourself.",
302204,,KongMing,"If you really feel guilty about that, I'll leave the rowing to you.",
302205,,KongMing,If you keep sailing straight... There might be..,
302206,,*,"Might be what? It's just a lake, don't tell me swirls can form in a lake…",
302207,,KongMing,"There will be NOTHING!!! I got you there, Senpai.",
302208,,*,"Look, we're approaching a lotus pond... But what are you doing? Are you holding a lotus leaf?",
302209,,KongMing,Maybe this can be used in cosplay when a character is related to the lotus~,
302210,,*,"That's a nice idea, maybe I might see you with this lotus leaf on your clothes next time.",
302211,,*,The swan group is coming back around... If we can get a little bit closer...,
302212,,KongMing,"Don't, they will fly away if we get any closer.",
302213,,*,What a pity...??? Why did you suddenly get so close?,
302214,,KongMing,"If you feel sad about not being able to see the swans up close, you can look at me instead~",
302301,Boating -3,KongMing,"I'm starting to feel kind of sleepy, excuse me, I want to take a nap~",
302302,,,KongMing lies at the end of the boat and closes her eyes.,
302303,,KongMing,Senpai? Senpai!!,
302304,,*,"Uh... KongMing? Sorry, I fell asleep, what's wrong?",
302305,,KongMing,"The clouds are gathering, it will begin raining any second. We'd better return now.",
302306,,*,"Okay, right away!",
302307,,*,You always look so beautiful...,
302308,,*,"I thought I was being quiet enough not to wake her up, but...",
302309,,KongMing,"Senpai, you may keep looking at me a bit longer, this is a rare chance you don't get everyday...",
302310,,*,"It's a sunny day, I'm not surprised you're sleepy. But I'll prepare this just in case you get sunburnt.",
302311,,KongMing,No... Don't come any closer...,
302312,,*,KongMing? What happened? Did you have a bad dream?,
302313,,KongMing,Senpai... I just felt strange because of the change in temperature...,
302314,,*,Oh... It is because I set a parasol for you... Sorry for making you feel odd.,
302315,,KongMing,"Don't be silly, I'm not blaming you for being thoughtful.",
302316,,KongMing,"But... If you stay this close, it's going to heat up~",
302317,,*,Uh? Sorry about that!,
303101,Picnic -1,*,A picnic? Really?,
303102,,KongMing,Don't you like picnics?,
303103,,*,"I do, but I didn't prepare anything for one.",
303104,,KongMing,"We can do that later, just think of where you want to have the picnic first~",
303105,,KongMing,"Nice choice, I also hid everything we need for a picnic right there.",
303106,,KongMing,Near the lake? I hope you still remember my warning about the mosquitos.,
303107,,*,I've got mosquito repellent with me so they won't be a problem.,
303108,,KongMing,"Then there's nothing to worry about... But if we're heading to the lake, we should stop by that hill for some supplies.",
303109,,*,Huh? What hill?,
303110,,KongMing,I hid everything we need for a picnic on that hill. It's about 500 meters from here~,
303111,,KongMing,Right here? But the view here isn't that great...,
303112,,*,Oh... It's not? Sorry I forgot to consider that...,
303113,,KongMing,It's not too late to change your mind... But let's get the things we need for a picnic from that hill first.,
303201,Picnic -2,*,"This is a full set... Food, drinks, even flowers... How long have you been planning for this?",
303202,,KongMing,Why do you look surprised?,
303203,,*,"I don't know why I'm surprised, this seems like something you'd do.",
303204,,KongMing,"Stop acting weird, you're wasting time during our date. By the way, what dessert do you like the most?",
303205,,KongMing,"Senpai, seriously?",
303206,,*,What?,
303207,,KongMing,"Well... Nothing, but this is just some average biscuits I randomly picked in a supermarket...",
303208,,KongMing,Why would you like something that's been in the oven for too long?,
303209,,*,"Part of it is burnt, but the rest part of it still tastes really nice~",
303210,,KongMing,Really? Actually... I was the one who...,
303211,,*,"It was made by you! As I guessed. But I'm telling the truth about the muffin, not just to comfort you.",
303212,,*,"This is a really nice cake, I'm not surprised you made this.",
303213,,KongMing,"Senpai, are you certain?",
303214,,*,W-what?... Did I guess wrong?,
303215,,KongMing,Of course! This cake was ordered from the best bakery in this city. No wonder it's delicious.,
303216,,KongMing,"I know you want to praise me, Senpai, but you chose the wrong dessert.",
303301,Picnic -3,*,The picnic you prepared is awesome~,
303302,,KongMing,But now we need to clean up the mess.,
303303,,*,"I agree, we cannot just leave it like this~",
303304,,*,"Done and done, you can check it out~",
303305,,KongMing,"Let's see~ All the tools are back together and the tableware cleaned. You've done a great job, Senpai.",
303306,,*,"The tableware's all cleaned up, where should I put them?",
303307,,KongMing,"Just give them to me~ Ouch, sorry for hitting you, but that's all your fault, Senpai.",
303308,,*,My fault?,
303309,,KongMing,You're getting too close for me to keep my wits about.,
303310,,Ranger,"Hey, you there! Clean up the mess right now! The other tourists won't like this!",
303311,,*,Who? Us?,
303312,,Ranger,"No, just you! How can you be this sloppy even during your own date!",
304101,Fly a kite -1,KongMing,"""I wish I could fly a kite..."" I remember you saying this before~",
304102,,*,Huh? Are you sure? But the weather now isn't that suitable for kites…,
304103,,KongMing,"My memory is perfect, and I could tell you meant it. Let's go to a store to buy a kite.",
304104,,*,"There's no wind and the air is very humid, how can we fly a kite in this condition?",
304105,,KongMing,"If that's what's worrying you, I'm going to say stop worrying.",
304106,,,"KongMing swings her fan and creates strong waves of wind as she speaks, and her power dehumidifies the air.",
304107,,KongMing,Now let's go and pick a kite.,
304108,,KongMing,"If you don't say anything, I'll take that as you agreeing with me. So let's just go and get ourselves a kite.",
304109,,*,Wait a minute...,
304110,,KongMing,What is it? Do you have anything to say?,
304111,,KongMing,"If you're worrying about the weather, I can tell you it's fine. According to my calculations, it will turn sunny very soon~",
304112,,KongMing,Really? Are you telling the truth?,
304113,,*,"Of course not, I totally have no interest in flying kites.",
304114,,KongMing,"Lying is really a bad habit, Senpai... But considering that this is a white lie, I won't blame you for it...",
304201,Fly a kite -2,KongMing,Now the problem is which kite we should purchase.,
304202,,Storekeeper,"You only need to consider the style of it, as the quality of each kite can be guaranteed.",
304203,,KongMing,"Senpai, I believe you can make the right decision~",
304204,,KongMing,The butterfly shaped ones? A very traditional style. But I'm not saying traditional is bad…,
304205,,KongMing,Let's just go outside and try it out.,
304206,,Storekeeper,"Nice choice, this is the biggest kite in our store, but you would need more windpower if you want to fly it into the sky~",
304207,,KongMing,"This is heavy! Senpai, please give me some help when we're flying this.",
304208,,KongMing,It has the shape of a cake! So cute~,
304209,,Storekeeper,Sorry... But that one is not for sale.,
304210,,*,May I ask why?,
304211,,Storekeeper,"This kite was made for my granddaughter, she's wanted a cake-shaped kite for a long time.",
304212,,KongMing,What a pity... But would you be willing to make a new one?,
304213,,Storekeeper,"It might take a while, but if you insist.",
304214,,KongMing,"Then I think I'll spend some more time in this store~ Senpai, are you with me?",
304301,Fly a kite -3,KongMing,Uh... Failed again,
304302,,KongMing,"I'm sure I calculated the wind speed and direction correctly, am I missing something?",
304303,,KongMing,"Senpai, do you want to give it a try?",
304304,,*,You should lift the kite above your head and run against the wind... Ouch!,
304305,,KongMing,"Haha, I was about to remind you about the strings~ You just tripped before I could say anything.",
304306,,*,"Just like this, you'll need to recover the strings when the kite starts to go down...",
304307,,KongMing,Senpai...,
304308,,*,What's wrong?,
304309,,KongMing,You... You're getting to close... I can't breathe...,
304310,,*,Oh... Sorry for that...,
304311,,*,"Maybe it will be easier this way, let's run against the wind together now~",
304312,,KongMing,Okay... Let's go~,
304313,,,"With my help, this time KongMing succeeded.",
304314,,KongMing,"We did it! All thanks to you, Senpai~",
305101,Chess -1,*,"Finally... A rest area, let's go take a rest~ But, why are there so many people?",
305102,,KongMing,"Looks like they're playing chess. Senpai, let's go take a look.",
305103,,Chess girl,"Greetings, we're just starting a new round, wanna join us?",
305104,,KongMing,"Well... I'd love to, but I think I should ask Senpai if he wants to stay around a little bit longer.",
305105,,*,"Since you've asked, of course I'm not going to say no.",
305106,,Chess girl,"Senpai is easy to be reasoned with, as the rumors state.",
305107,,KongMing,"Senpai is a gentleman, there's no reason he would disagree…",
305108,,KongMing,"But still, I hope Senpai could drop his gentle act in some situations...",
305109,,KongMing,"Sorry but since Senpai wants to leave, I cannot play chess with you.",
305110,,Chess girl,"But as KongMing's boyfriend, you should respect her hobbies more, Senpai!",
305111,,*,Wait a minute... Boyfriend?,
305112,,Chess girl,"Why are you acting so weird? You're on a date, aren't you?",
305113,,KongMing,"Haha, I knew this would cause a misunderstanding...",
305114,,*,"KongMing, why are you standing there laughing? Shouldn't you help me explain?",
305115,,*,Take your time~,
305116,,KongMing,Is that okay? This could be a waste of time during our date.,
305117,,*,"That doesn't matter, the date is great as long as you're happy.",
305118,,Chess girl,"Nice, that's how a qualified boyfriend should act!",
305201,Chess -2,Chess girl,You made a really bad move~ I've got you cornered.,
305202,,KongMing,"Uh... Didn't see that coming, what should I do? Maybe Senpai has an idea?",
305203,,*,Maybe you should make your next move right here...,
305204,,Chess girl,"Senpai, that's called cheating in a chess game! Besides, I believe this won't be that big of a problem for KongMing.",
305205,,*,"But, she asked me for help… Is this another joke?",
305206,,Chess girl,Senpai! Stop acting weird in order to give KongMing hints!,
305207,,*,I wasn't doing that.,
305208,,Chess girl,"Yes you were! I can understand you care very much about her, but that to me seems more like you're showing off.",
305209,,Chess girl,"Just as I predicted, you win again, guess that trap didn't trouble you for very long.",
305210,,KongMing,"That's not true. I actually had a tough time trying to solve it, and I even asked Senpai for help~ But Senpai ignored me...",
305301,Chess -3,KongMing,"So, this is it, it's time for us to leave~",
305302,,Chess girl,"But we're just getting started, don't you want to continue?",
305303,,KongMing,"I'm on a date with Senpai right now, I don't want to waste his time…",
305304,,*,"Sorry, but we're still on a date. If we spend all our time here, there'll be no time for other activities.",
305305,,Chess girl,Uh... But where else can you go if you're just having a date in this park?,
305306,,KongMing,"Senpai, you will make things more complicated.",
305307,,*,Maybe I can also have a round with KongMing.,
305308,,Chess girl,"Senpai, stop being silly. In the field of chess, she's way out of your league.",
305309,,KongMing,"But maybe I can teach Senpai, and make you a better chess player.",
305310,,*,"No, as KongMing's boyfriend, I won't let you interfere with our date.",
305311,,Chess girl,Seriously? I remember you refusing to admit your relationship before this.,
305312,,KongMing,"Stop... Just stop it! You are making me very embarassed, Senpai!",
306101,Fan Store -1,Storekeeper,"Welcome~ Miss KongMing, it's been a long time. We've just gotten some new fans in stock, do you want to take a look?",
306102,,*,You are a regular customer here?,
306103,,Storekeeper,"Of course she is, and she is also a close friend of mine~",
306104,,Storekeeper,"If you need any information about her, I might be able to help you~",
306105,,Storekeeper,That's a classic question... Let's just say you're the first lucky person she has ever brought to my store.,
306106,,KongMing,Hey! It's impolite to talk about me like I'm not here.,
306107,,Storekeeper,That's all? I thought you'd be more interested in other information about her.,
306108,,Storekeeper,But the daily life of KongMing is actually...,
306109,,KongMing,"Senpai, if you need to know more about this, I can answer that myself...",
306110,,Storekeeper,Boring--- You shouldn't have let such a rare chance slip away.,
306201,Fan Store -2,Storekeeper,"I think all the new fans will suit you a lot, so why don't you take all three of them?",
306202,,KongMing,"I won't fall for that again, I'll just take the one with the wind patterns.",
306203,,Storekeeper,What a pity... I cannot think of anyone else who suits these fans better... But why don't we let your boyfriend decide which to take?,
306204,,KongMing,"Senpai, you really know my tastes~",
306205,,Storekeeper,"Good choice, the patterns on this fan was designed by a famous designer. This fan is the only copy in store~ There's no doubt KongMing would like it~",
306206,,KongMing,"Actually, I think this fan is way more expensive than I deserve, so I decided not to take it. But if you really love this sort of pattern, maybe we can go bamboo sketching together next time.",
306207,,KongMing,"Look, the flower pattern is all over the fan. This is just over the top.",
306208,,*,Don't you think the patterns on the fan will make you look more beatiful?,
306209,,KongMing,Are you serious about what you just said?,
306210,,*,I believe you can tell if I lied or not.,
306211,,KongMing,Well... I don't think you're lying...,
306301,Fan Store -3,Storekeeper,"Now would you like to customize the fan you've made? You know, it's important to make proper decorations on every fan~",
306302,,KongMing,Not this time~,
306303,,Storekeeper,Is it because you haven't decided what to purchase yet? Why don't you let your friend make the choice for you?,
306304,,*,"Since KongMing said she doesn't need it, we won't get it.",
306305,,Storekeeper,I think you should at least try to understand what she's trying to imply!,
306306,,KongMing,This one will surely help protect the fan from impact~,
306307,,KongMing,"It's too long, it'll trouble me day to day.",
306308,,*,"Oh! Sorry for forgetting practicalities, I just thought it suits you and your fan the most.",
306309,,Storekeeper,"That's definitely true, the tassel you are holding was originally designed for the new fan.",
307101,Resting area -1,*,"It's a rest area, why don't we sit down and rest for a while? After such a long walk, you must be tired.",
307102,,*,Huh? Why are you staring at me?,
307103,,KongMing,"Nothing, I just wonder if you are this gentle to all girls.",
307104,,KongMing,That's a boring answer I wouldn't want to hear...,
307105,,KongMing,"I don't think so, you're actually making it harder on yourself. Sometimes you should just listen to your heart.",
307106,,KongMing,How can you say such embarrassing things without hesitation? Have you answered like this a million times already?,
307201,Resting area -2,KongMing,"I didn't notice time passing by so quickly, I'm getting thirsty...",
307202,,*,Do you need anything to drink?,
307203,,KongMing,"Of course... Senpai, can you help me out?",
307204,,KongMing,"Are you giving your only bottle to me? Just warning you, I'm not giving it back~",
307205,,KongMing,"If we share the drink, it will be pretty embarrassing, and not hygienic.",
307206,,KongMing,That's a good idea~ Maybe I can help cool you down after you return~,
307207,,KongMing,"I'd hate to refuse you, but soft-drinks won't actually help solve thirst, it will only make it worse.",
307301,Resting area -3,*,I was worrying that you would refuse this invitation due to the work you have...,
307302,,KongMing,"But here I am~ I would't refuse any invitation from you, Senpai. I've even made an itinerary list for this date~",
307303,,KongMing,"What about you, Senpai? Have you prepared anything?",
307304,,KongMing,That's incredible! We both had a plan for this date!,
307305,,KongMing,A present for me? Can I open the box now?,
307306,,*,You sure can... But what's inside the box might disappoint you.,
307307,,KongMing,I don't think I will be disappointed. I'm happy to have it as long as the gift is from you.,
307308,,KongMing,Huh? No reply?,
307309,,KongMing,"Senpai, your face is turning red... That's fine, I think this is the best answer I can imagine.",
308101,Cat Café -1,Waitress,"Welcome~ Oh, you look very familiar. Have you been here before?",
308102,,KongMing,"Senpai, are you a regular customer of this Café?",
308103,,Waitress,"Now I can tell for sure. See, the name is on our VIP list~",
308104,,Waitress,Would you want to use your VIP membership privilege today?,
308105,,Waitress,"But how? Even if my memory isn't serving me right, the list is still right there...",
308106,,KongMing,"I guess there's another ""Senpai"" then...",
308107,,Waitress,"Alright, let me record on the list... Now follow me, the kittens are waiting~",
308108,,*,Let me explain...,
308109,,KongMing,"Don't bother, anyone can have some secret habits",
308110,,KongMing,"So, you're charmed by the cute kitties here?",
308111,,KongMing,No other reasons? I seriously doubt that...,
308201,Cat Café -2,Waitress,I strongly suggest you to try the accompany-a-kitty service in our store~,
308202,,Waitress,You can pick the cat you like~,
308203,,*,Her cheeks feel so squishy~ But why does she not look happy today?,
308204,,KongMing,It appears she's tired because of the weather~ Or maybe... She sees someone she doesn't want to see?,
308205,,KongMing,"She has very beautiful eyes, and fluffy hair~",
308206,,KongMing,Come over here...,
308207,,*,"Actually the coffee here also tastes nice, you can try it later... Wait a minute, is that...?",
308208,,KongMing,It's the hair of the cat~ And it has been in your cup for more than a minute~,
308209,,KongMing,Huh? What is it? Getting used to me already? This is a really perfect cat for cat-lovers~,
308210,,*,Come over here and take some snacks~,
308211,,KongMing,"Oof, looks like that doesn't work.",
308212,,*,I guess... You must be more attractive than snacks to her~,
308301,Cat Café -3,Waitress,"Sorry to interrupt, but the time for our service is up, if you'd like to continue our accompany-a-kitty service, you'd need to pay an extra fee.",
308302,,KongMing,"Well, I think it feels great with a cat in my arms~",
308303,,*,So let's extend the service time.,
308304,,KongMing,Really? That's awesome~... It feels so good to hug a cat.,
308305,,KongMing,Is that okay? It would be pricy.,
308306,,*,"Don't worry, the price is not something I shall consider as long as it can make you feel happy~",
308307,,Waitress,"Okay, please then let go of the cat, she needs to rest~",
308308,,KongMing,Uh... I feel like something's missing without a cat in my arms…,
309101,Bookstore -1,*,"Wow, there're so many customers~ I believe the entire store is occupied…",
309102,,KongMing,But can you still help me find a seat? I'll meet you at the rest area after collecting all the books I need.,
309103,,*,"Okay, I'll try to get a seat that you can find easily.",
309104,,*,Now... The only problem is the seat...,
309105,,,"After searching for a while, I noticed 2 spare seats in the corner of the store. But before I become happy, I heard a girl behind me.",
309106,,Girl,"Senpai, can I take the seat right next to yours?",
309107,,*,"Sorry, but this seat is occupied for a special someone. She might get angry if I give it to you~",
309108,,KongMing,Am I that easy to get angry?,
309109,,*,"Huh? Oh, you have found the book you need already? And I was just kidding about...",
309110,,KongMing,"I see, but now I start to doubt if the ""special someone"" part is also a joke.",
309111,,*,"I can also see another empty seat right there, maybe you can take that one?",
309112,,Girl,"So, this seat is prepared for a special someone?",
309113,,*,Actually... It's...,
309114,,Girl,Why are you hesitating? Is it not someone important?,
309115,,*,"Sure, please~",
309116,,Girl,Thanks a lot! But why are you leaving your seat now?,
309117,,*,Becuase I've already promised to another person to keep another seat nearby for her. Now my current seat is not very ideal for that promise~,
309118,,KongMing,"Finally found you, Senpai! I've got the book I need and some seats for us, let's go to the seats together~",
309201,Bookstore -2,*,You always study so hard no matter where you are~,
309202,,KongMing,Why don't you do the same as I do? There are so many books in this store and I'm sure you can find one or two you would want~,
309203,,*,That's more like forcing me to read~,
309204,,KongMing,I'm surprised to see your choice... Let me see...,
309205,,KongMing,"Senpai, I've got a secret to tell you~",
309206,,*,What secret?,
309207,,KongMing,The secret is... XXX is the criminal...,
309208,,*,Hey! Spoiler alert!,
309209,,KongMing,"Haha, you look really cute after receiving spoilers~",
309210,,KongMing,"That's a surprise, I thought you would choose something else.",
309211,,*,"I don't know what you think, but I actually love to study. Let me prove that to you right now~",
309212,,*,zzz...,
309213,,KongMing,Now that's really silly proof.,
309214,,KongMing,A textbook? Are you serious?,
309215,,*,"Yes, as I still have a lot of subjects to come up with~",
309216,,KongMing,But... It's really an unwise choice since you've got me with you.,
309301,Bookstore -3,*,"Read this paragraph, it's really interesting~",
309302,,*,"Hello? Oh, she's got asleep already... I should've insisted her rest more every day…",
309303,,KongMing,"Huh? ... Sorry, I must have fallen asleep because of the exhausting... Sorry for keep you waiting.",
309304,,*,"Don't worry, it's only been half an hour... And it's never boring to look at you.",
309305,,KongMing,Senpai... I'm still not awake enough for this...,
309306,,,"When I approach her to try to wake her up, I notice her ears starting to turn red.",
309307,,*,KongMing's ear is turning red... The store must be too hot for her.,
309308,,*,"Since KongMing is sleeping, maybe I should also take a nap~",
309309,,,"And when I'm about to close my eyes, I heard KongMing speak.",
309310,,KongMing,"Senpai, you shouldn't sleep here... That's really impolite...",
310101,Arcade -1,*,Uh... I never thought you'd be interested in arcade games...,
310102,,KongMing,You got a problem with that?,
310103,,*,"No, I just never thought you'd come to a place like this.",
310104,,KongMing,"Maybe it would surprise you, but I come here more regularly than you do.",
310105,,*,Wait... Check out this claw machine... It provides the latest doll as reward.,
310106,,KongMing,"That looks cute, I hope Senpai can get it for me.",
310107,,*,"Don't worry, let me get it for you...",
310108,,KongMing,Looks like you failed...,
310109,,*,"Don't worry, I just need another attempt and then I'll be able to... Uh... I failed again...",
310110,,KongMing,Even if you failed to get the doll... I'm already feeling great about how hard you're willing to try~,
310111,,KongMing,"Senpai, do you really not want to try?",
310112,,*,"Sorry, but I'm really not good at this~",
310113,,KongMing,Okay... That shouldn't be a problem for me...,
310114,,,"Just like KongMing expected, she successfully caught all the dolls inside the machine without fail.",
310115,,*,KongMing is really great at this~ But... Why do I feel like she's not happy about the results?,
310116,,*,"Actually, I'm not so good at this, so I hope we can do this together~",
310117,,KongMing,"Okay... Right now! Senpai, press the button!",
310118,,*,Come on... Don't miss!,
310119,,KongMing,"Almost... almost... Did it! Senpai, there's nothing cannot be done if we're together!",
310201,Arcade -2,Player A,"That's amazing, you hit the finish line once again...",
310202,,Player B,"Why are you praising me just for finishing the game? See the leaderboard, praise me after I break the record this KM made!",
310203,,Player A,"Since you've mentioned that, I've never seen this KM here. I wonder where she practices her skills.",
310204,,*,It's a racing game... And that girl surely is good at it~,
310205,,KongMing,"Senpai, if you are really interested in this game, you should try it.",
310206,,*,"Uh... I almost crashed again, but I can overtake the opponent here... Oops, guess I will lose this time.",
310207,,KongMing,"Senpai... If you wouldn't mind, please let me take over...",
310208,,*,"Okay, please help me out~",
310209,,*,... You're now at the first place! It's incredible to see you get there as I made so many mistakes in the former tracks!,
310210,,KongMing,Hmm... May I ask why?,
310211,,*,"If I have to name one, I'd like to see how you do it.",
310212,,KongMing,"Okay, I just got another reason to win this game...",
310213,,*,"You broke the record... Wait a minute, KM? You are that KM?",
310214,,KongMing,Shh... Don't let anyone else know about this.,
310215,,KongMing,"Really?... Senpai, your excuse would be more believable if you stopped staring at the screen.",
310301,Arcade -3,Waitress,"We've got a lottery event today, maybe you would want to give it a try?",
310302,,*,What's the prize for the event?,
310303,,Waitress,"We placed them in the display area, you can go and take a look~",
310304,,KongMing,Wow! It's the limited edition of the statue of Lovely,
310305,,*,I think we should participate in the lottery if you really want that statue~,
310306,,*,"Alright, let me scratch off the cover of this ticket!",
310307,,Waitress,"Let's see... Congratulations, you've won the third prize~",
310308,,*,I guess that statue isn't the third prize... Sorry about that.,
310309,,KongMing,"Don't worry, I'm already happy enough to have a prize you won for me.",
310310,,KongMing,Huh? Me?,
310311,,*,"Of course! I don't think it is my lucky day, so you might get a better result than me.",
310312,,KongMing,"Okay, then I'll scratch off this one.",
310313,,Waitress,"Let's see... Congratulations, you've won the second prize~",
310314,,*,Great! I knew you would win a prize!,
310315,,KongMing,But... I don't think the statue is the second prize.,
310316,,*,"Let's just scratch off 1 ticket each, so we will have a bigger chance to win the prize you want.",
310317,,Waitress,"Let's see... Congratulations, you've won the third prize and the ultimate prize! You're really lucky to win the biggest prize of this event!",
310318,,KongMing,Wait... Can I have that statue of Lovely as the reward?,
310319,,Waitress,"Of course, please wait a minute and I'll pack it up for you.",
310320,,*,I knew it was your lucky day! I'm so happy to see you win the prize you want.,
310321,,KongMing,"I couldn't have done it without you... Thank you so much, Senpai!",
311101,Flume Ride -1,*,Perfect! The construction of Flume Ride is complete! Let's go give it a try.,
311102,,KongMing,But... That would make my clothes wet... And I didn't bring a swimming suit...,
311103,,KongMing,"Wait... There's a store right over there sells swimsuits... The operator of this amusement park didn't miss any chance to make money... Senpai, what now?",
311104,,*,I think this one suits you the best~,
311105,,KongMing,Let me try it on...,
311106,,*,Does it fit?,
311107,,KongMing,"Yes, it feels perfect... Senpai, how did you know my exact size?",
311108,,*,"Just go and choose the one you like the most and I'll pay for it, no matter the cost~",
311109,,KongMing,"Really? That's so nice of you, now I can go Flume Ride without worries~",
311110,,*,"This is a really nice day, I believe the clothes will dry fast enough under the sun, so just don't bother buying a swimsuit...",
311111,,KongMing,"That's the worst thing I've heard today! Senpai, there's a reason that not many students like you.",
311201,Flume Ride -2,*,"We're speeding up, guess the most exciting moment is about to arrive~",
311202,,KongMing,Oh! The water is getting turbulent!... Senpai... Is it really safe for us to stay on a shaking boat?,
311203,,*,"Don't worry, I'll be there if the boat cannot do its job.",
311204,,KongMing,Really? Will you take my hand when that happens like you are now?,
311205,,*,Of course! I'll never let go~,
311206,,*,I'm so happy to experience this with you!!!!!,
311207,,KongMing,"Huh? Senpai, why you speak that so loud...",
311208,,*,Just join me~ Speak out what you want with the loudest voice possible~,
311209,,KongMing,Huh? Me too?... Okay... I'm so happy to experience this with Senpai!!!!!,
311210,,*,KongMing? What is it?,
311211,,KongMing,Don't worry... I'm just... Afraid...,
311301,Flume Ride -3,Staff,"We're now entering the safe area, you can get out the boat and swim if you want to~",
311302,,KongMing,Swim?,
311303,,,KongMing touches the water with hesitation.,
311304,,KongMing,Should I do that?,
311305,,*,See? It's not as dangerous as you thought~,
311306,,KongMing,"You're right... It's comfortable underwater, I don't know why I was so scared…",
311307,,*,"So... Since you're doing great, take this!",
311308,,KongMing,Huh? Senpai! Stop splashing me! That's  really impolite!,
311309,,KongMing,"I sure am curious about it, but I don't know if it's safe...",
311310,,*,"Don't worry, the water flow is pretty gentle~ Maybe I can even record your smile~",
311311,,KongMing,"I don't think me getting myself wet is something worth recording... Wait... Senpai, you really sound like a pervert!",
311312,,*,"In fact, I cannot swim either. So why don't we take our time on the boat and enjoy the sunshine~",
311313,,KongMing,Sorry…,
311314,,*,Why do you feel sorry? Just come and enjoy the sunshine with me.,
312101,Roller Coaster -1,*,Are you serious?,
312102,,KongMing,About what? Is that...,
312103,,*,I mean the rollercoaster of course! I never imagined you would ask to go on that~,
312104,,*,"But since you've asked, I won't refuse, let's go~",
312105,,KongMing,"Wait... Senpai... The penguins in this plaza also look cute, let's watch them a little bit longer.",
312106,,*,"Like I just said, I wouldn't say no to you.",
312107,,KongMing,I'm very happy to hear you say so... I'm still not ready to hear that so often…,
312108,,*,I somehow feel jealous about them...,
312109,,KongMing,"Senpai, why do you say that, do you want to become as fat as the penguins?",
312110,,*,"No, I just want to be fed by you just like them. But maybe I won't get a chance like that.",
312111,,KongMing,"That's not true, I can do that right now! Here, open your mouth~",
312112,,*,Why did you suddenly change your mind? Are you starting to get scared of going on a rollercoaster?,
312113,,KongMing,"What are you talking about? Why would I be afraid? I just find the penguins cute, that's all!",
312201,Roller Coaster -2,Staff,Are you a couple?,
312202,,*,"Yes, and please arrange us on the same row because for that.",
312203,,Staff,"Sorry but we only have one seat left for the current ride, would you mind being separated?",
312204,,*,"We're on a date, so we'd like to sit side by side, I think we can take the next one.",
312205,,KongMing,"Of course, I don't mind waiting~",
312206,,KongMing,No... I still want to have you sitting next to me...,
312207,,*,"Don't worry, let KongMing get on, I'll take the next one.",
312208,,KongMing,"I don't want to! Senpai, why can't you understand how important it is for you to sit beside me!!!",
312209,,*,Huh? Why are you so angry?,
312301,Roller Coaster -3,*,I heard they have a service to take photos for you when you're on the rollercoaster... I believe they print the photos here.,
312302,,Staff,Of course... I'm sure I took all the tourists in the picture~,
312303,,KongMing,Really? Can we have one?,
312304,,Staff,"Of course you can, but they're not for free~",
312305,,*,You still look so cute even when you're afraid. It's really a good idea to give this to you.,
312306,,KongMing,Is that okay? Don't you want it for yourself?,
312307,,*,You still look so cute when feeling afraid. I think I will keep it!,
312308,,KongMing,How did I look? Let me have a peek~,
312309,,*,It's too cute to even share~,
312310,,*,It's really embarrassing to see me act like this... Especially when KongMing is beside me.,
312311,,*,"Well, I think we should leave now.",
312312,,KongMing,Huh? You're not buying the photo? Did anything happen?,
313101,Bumper Cars -1,Staff,"Welcome, if you want to try the bumper cars, let me explain the rules first...",
313102,,*,"Please don't bother, I'm already a master of this~",
313103,,Staff,So do you want to drive a bumper car with 2 seats?,
313104,,*,And you will find out soon how well I can drive~,
313105,,KongMing,Is that so? I'm looking forward to it~,
313106,,KongMing,"Senpai, are you serious about this?",
313107,,*,"Of course, like I said, I'm a master of this. Just try not to cry when you lose.",
313108,,KongMing,We'll find out soon.,
313109,,KongMing,Why? We are on date and we should choose a bumper car with 2 seats.,
313110,,*,"Sorry, I lied... I actually don't drive that well, and I'm afraid that won't be a pleasant experience if you get on my car.",
313111,,KongMing,"That doesn't matter, it's always a good time if you are with me.",
313201,Bumper Cars -2,*,This is the only car available...,
313202,,KongMing,"I'm fine with sitting in a car with you, and now it's time for us to come up with a plan.",
313203,,*,Plan? Why would we need a plan?,
313204,,KongMing,I believe you don't want to be knocked out by others in the early stages of this game.,
313205,,*,??? Why do you sound even more professional than I do?,
313206,,*,Let's attack others before they attack us.,
313207,,KongMing,That's a good idea!,
313208,,*,Let's find a suitable target and attack their car the entire game.,
313209,,KongMing,"That sounds mean, but it is actually a wise choice~",
313210,,*,I'm not the kind of person that needs a plan. I think we should improvise.,
313211,,KongMing,But we might lose because of ...,
313212,,*,"Well... We're here to play the game, and the spirit of that is to enjoy ourselves.",
313301,Bumper Cars -3,KongMing,"There! Let's crush that car, Senpai! Oops! Someone got us first~",
313302,,*,Wow... You're so into it~,
313303,,KongMing,Not that much... But I still want to get my hands on the wheel.,
313304,,*,"Just try if you want to, I've got faith in you~",
313305,,KongMing,I was just saying... But I won't let you down!,
313306,,*,Changing the driver half-way through is dangerous. Maybe you can be the driver in the next round.,
313307,,KongMing,"Senpai, you're being too cautious...",
313308,,*,How can I not be? Isn't that my responsibility to make sure my girlfriend is safe?,
313309,,*,Watch this!,
313310,,,BAM!,
313311,,*,How about that? I've taken another one down!,
313312,,KongMing,...,
314101,Dining Area -1,KongMing,I'm getting a little bit hungry...,
314102,,*,Uh... Let me check where we can get some food... The dining area is right in front of us!,
314103,,*,"Here, taste some of this~",
314104,,KongMing,Uh... That looks really expensive...,
314105,,*,"Don't worry about it, you just need to make sure you don't scald your tongue~",
314106,,KongMing,"Senpai, why don't you test the temperature for me first~",
314107,,KongMing,What's this...?,
314108,,*,"This is a turkey leg with a special sauce, it's highly recommended here.",
314109,,KongMing,It's too big for me... What a pity...,
314110,,*,Does that mean I need to return it?,
314111,,KongMing,"I mean, if you can help to cut it into small pieces... That should be fine~",
314112,,KongMing,What's this?,
314113,,*,"I baked these cookies for our date, try it.",
314114,,KongMing,You mean you baked them yourself?,
314115,,*,"Absolutely! It might look bad, but I'm sure they're delicious~",
314116,,KongMing,"Okay, let me give it a try~",
314201,Dining Area -2,Wild Cat,Meow~,
314202,,KongMing,"Senpai, did you hear something? Sounds like a cat~",
314203,,*,Huh? I thought wild cats wouldn't come to such crowded place.,
314204,,KongMing,"But look over there, it's a cat moving through the bushes, can we lure it here?",
314205,,*,And now we just need to wait~,
314206,,KongMing,"Oh! The cat seems have smelled the food, it's approaching now.",
314207,,*,"Shh, you need to calm down if you want to hug it.",
314208,,KongMing,"I will! I never feel you are so dependable like now, Senpai~",
314209,,*,Meow~ Come here~,
314210,,KongMing,"Senpai, I never thought you would do that... Cute though...",
314211,,*,Cute? Me?,
314212,,*,You must be too tired. Amusement parks are kind of inhabitable for cats~,
314213,,KongMing,"Senpai, are you trying to say I was lying?",
314214,,*,Huh? No no no! I wasn't even thinking that!,
314301,Dining Area -3,Florist,"Do you want flowers? Senpai, you definitely need one for your girlfriend~",
314302,,*,Are you speaking to me?,
314303,,Florist,Of course! And your girlfriend looks really familiar... Oh! It's KongMing! I've always been a crazy fan~,
314304,,KongMing,Thank you... What a coincidence~,
314305,,Florist,My pleasure! So... Are you dating Senpai...?,
314306,,*,How much do you want for all your flowers?,
314307,,Florist,500 Coins...,
314308,,*,"Alright, I will take them all.",
314309,,Florist,"Senpai, why are you trying to avoid my question?",
314310,,*,What am I avoiding? I'm just purchasing some flowers for my date with KongMing~,
314311,,KongMing,Senpai! Stop acting weird!,
314312,,*,"Yes, and as you see, we're on a date~",
314313,,Florist,Are... Are you telling the truth?,
314314,,KongMing,"Yes, we're... But I think you might be thinking something wrong...",
314315,,Florist,OH NO!!! I lost my KongMing!,
314316,,KongMing,"Wait... Senpai, you don't need to leave like you're avoiding something…",
315101,Fishing Tournament -1,*,There's a crowd up ahead~ It must be something interesting. Let's go and take a look.,
315102,,KongMing,Is that okay? It's actually not safe to be in such a big crowd.,
315103,,*,"Don't worry about that, that danger means nothing to me~",
315104,,KongMing,Is it okay to give up something you're interested in?,
315105,,*,"That's nothing, your safety is always more important.",
315106,,*,"Don't let go, I don't want to lose you after getting through the crowd.",
315107,,KongMing,Okay... I will...,
315108,,*,"Alright, now I'm ready for this! Follow me!",
315109,,KongMing,"W-wait... Senpai, you don't have to do this.",
315201,Fishing Tournament -2,,"After struggling a while, I made a way into the crowd with KongMing",
315202,,*,Make way please~ So it's the fishing game that's attracting the crowd.,
315203,,KongMing,Is that a simulating game? Looks like the player who gets the most fish in limited time can win a reward.,
315204,,*,I think so. Why don't we give it a try?,
315205,,KongMing,You're making it hard for me to say no…,
315206,,KongMing,"Senpai, are you serious about this? I have no knowledge of fishing...",
315207,,*,"Trying everything for the first time is difficult, but I believe you can do it right, just like how you succeed in other fields~",
315208,,KongMing,Okay...,
315209,,*,"I've thought it over, just let me join the game, please take care of the fish I get.",
315210,,KongMing,I will.,
315211,,*,2 fishing rods please~,
315212,,KongMing,"Two? Senpai, are you joining this game too?",
315213,,*,Yup! It's a rare chance to have such a race. Please go easy on me~,
315301,Fishing Tournament -3,*,I've got 5 fish~ What about you? Guess you've got even more than I do~,
315302,,KongMing,I...,
315303,,*,You?,
315304,,KongMing,I didn't get even one. Sorry to let you down.,
315305,,KongMing,"That's impossible, you're saying all first timers get nothing... This comfort makes no sense...",
315306,,KongMing,Are you sure? Maybe the result will be the same.,
315307,,*,The KongMing I know wouldn't give up easily. Now just get your fishing rod and get ready.,
315308,,KongMing,The amount doesn't sound right...,
315309,,*,"But it makes sense~ Do the math, we're on a date, so I can just give you 50% what I got.",
315310,,KongMing,Oh... Since you've said that... It's starting to make sense...,
401001,Osananajimi 1,Giana,"Senpai, I heard a new coffee shop is opened in the Academy.",
401002,,*,"Really? But unfortunately, I don't know anything about it…",
401003,,Giana,That’s the reason I come for you~ Let’s go and try the Latte there.,
401004,,Fencer,Latte... But I think you should take…,
401005,,*,"Huh? Fencer, take what?",
401006,,Fencer,Mocha...,
401007,,KongMing,"Haha, maybe I should pick another time to come since you’re all here.",
401008,,KongMing,"But the bestseller there is black coffee, and just because of that... Senpai, you should follow my suggestion.",
402001,Osananajimi 2,*,Why am I not suprised...,
402002,,Giana,"What a coincidence! But since we’re all here, Senpai, it’s time for you to decide whose suggestion you’re going to follow.",
402003,,KongMing,"I don’t think that’s necessary. Just like I said, black coffee is the bestseller here.",
402004,,Fencer,But... That might be too bitter for Senpai... I still believe Mocha is a better choice.,
402005,,Giana,Since when have you become an expert of Senpai’s taste?,
402006,,Giana,Senpai~ I still strongly suggest Latte. You’ll surely love the smooth taste the milk in the coffee provides.,
403001,Osananajimi 3,*,Thank god there’re still other options on the menu... But the atmosphere seems have become worse.,
403002,,*,"Now we’ve got our coffee, it’s time to return home~ I believe you still got works to do.",
403003,,All Girls,No!,
403004,,*,Huh? Was I missing something?,
403005,,Fencer,If others decide to stay...,
403006,,Giana,Coffee won’t taste as good if you take it home~,
403007,,KongMing,"There’s a table for four right over there! Senpai, you can just sit right next to one of us~",
404001,Osananajimi 4,*,I should check the weather broadcast today... The rain is getting bigger now...,
404002,,Fencer,Senpai...,
404003,,*,"Oh, Fencer? I’m surprised that you haven't left yet.",
404004,,Fencer,"If you don’t mind, you can share an umbrella with me…",
404005,,*,Can I?,
404006,,Giana,"Senpai, if you want to share an umbrella, you should share mine with me... After all, the umbrella Fencer has is too small for two.",
404007,,KongMing,"Senpai, we still got work to do in Student Union, so I suggest you share my umbrella with me.",
405001,Osananajimi 5,*,Why am I here again? Please don’t tell me there’s another new student I need to go and welcome.,
405002,,Hottie,Not so soon... I just want to give you something special...,
405003,,*,Something special? What’s that?,
405004,,Hottie,"A gift to thank you for helping me... Here, two tickets for the latest released movie. You can even invite a friend of yours.",
405005,,*,Movie tickets... Only for 2...,
406001,Osananajimi 6,*,I never predicted things will be like this... And obviously 2 tickets are not enough for all four of us...,
406002,,Fencer,"Please don’t worry, I’ve already booked a ticket for myself, Senpai...",
406003,,Giana,"I’m not that thoughtful like Fencer, Senpai, can I have one of your tickets and sit right next to you?",
406004,,KongMing,Stop fooling us. I just saw you at the box office. You must have purchased one.,
406005,,KongMing,"And even if you didn’t, you can still take my ticket as I shall be the one who sits right next to Senpai.",
407001,Osananajimi 7,*,Huh? Is the flower for me?,
407002,,Bud Elf,Of course! And this is a new breed we just developed.,
407003,,Bud Elf,Consider this a gift for all the helps you’ve offered. We think you might need it if you want to date a girl or something.,
407004,,*,I think that explains why I’ve never saw such flower before...,
407005,,Bud Elf,"It’s colorful and cute, I believe no girl would refuse a gift like this.",
407006,,*,What should I do with this? Who should I give the flower to?,
408001,Osananajimi 8,Hottie,"Mid-Term Exam is coming, I hope you’ve fully prepared for this. If you failed to pass the exam, there---will---be---consequence!",
408002,,*,I’m done! I didn’t pay attention to the class! I will surely fail in the exam!,
408003,,KongMing,"But actually, you still stand a chance.",
408004,,*,"Huh? KongMing?... That’s right, I still have hope to pass the exam with your help.",
408005,,Fencer,"Wait... If you need to review for the exam, I can also help...",
408006,,*,Fencer is also good at studying...,
408007,,Giana,"Being a good student doesn’t mean you will also be a good teacher, I'm pretty sure I can help Senpai more properly.",
409001,Osananajimi 9,*,"Didn’t noticed that I’ve been walking this long... Wait, why is the divination lodge here?",
409002,,Amelia,"Tch, why they still can find me even after I’ve hidden so far away?",
409003,,*,Amelia... Why are you here?,
409004,,Amelia,Just tell me what you want to know and leave after I tell you the answer. I don’t want to be interrupted.,
409005,,*,Ask what?,
409006,,Amelia,Don’t pretend to be innocent. Everyone comes for me just to get the answers to their questions... And the people like you would probably want to ask the future relationship with someone.,
409007,,Amelia,Now don’t waste my time and tell me what you want to know.,
201210,Ferris Wheel -2,Fencer,Senpai... You're quite casual about this...,
204109,Roller Coaster -1,Fencer,Well... Senpai should just try it without me...,
